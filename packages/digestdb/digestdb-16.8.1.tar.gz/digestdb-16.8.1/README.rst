digestdb
========

Digestdb provides database style (e.g. SQL) access to binary data files
stored in a balanced set of file system directories.

Digestdb aims to provide an efficient strategy for storing and serving
lots of binary files while maintaining a high level of performance.

DigestDB was developed specifically for scenarios that required storing and
recalling large numbers of large (~100K - ~40MB) binary blobs.

DigestDB is written using Python 3.5 and is licensed under the MPL license.

The project documentation can be found on
`ReadTheDocs <http://digestdb.readthedocs.org/>`_.

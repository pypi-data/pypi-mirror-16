This document outlines how to rebuild the documentation.

General setup:
- Install Sphinx, `pip install sphinx`
- run `make html` in this folder, to update the documentation.

If code files were added, the easiest way to reflect code changes in the
documentation by referencing the file from within pydrive.rst.

If a non-code related file was added (it has to have the ".rst" ending),
then add the file name to the list of names under "Table of Contents"
in index.rst. Make sure to add the file name excluding the ".rst" file ending.

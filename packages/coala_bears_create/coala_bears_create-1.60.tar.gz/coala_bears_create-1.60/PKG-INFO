Description: coala-bears-create
        ==================
        
            coala-bears-create is a simple CLI program which let's you scaffold
            a ``coala-bear`` in minutes. It asks you certain questions and based on your
            answers, a template for bears and tests is automatically
            generated for you. Now you just have to modify this template to add
            more specific details and you're good to go.
        
        Note: Python 3.3+ only.

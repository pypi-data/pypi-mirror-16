# geesefly Mirror

This is my mirror of Jonathan Bowman's geesefly.py, and made
available in pip.

## Installation

To install from pip:

    $ pip install geesefly

## About

geesefly.py is a pure Python implementation of the Skein hash function
and Threefish tweakable block cipher. It also includes a pseudo-random
number generator based on Skein, and Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) based
functionality for encrypting variable-length data.

geesefly.py is slow.  If you want a high-performance Python
implementation of Skein and Threefish, I highly recommend PySkein,
available at http://packages.python.org/pyskein/

In PySkein, the heavy lifting is done in compiled C, and hashes data
at a much faster rate than geesefly.py.

In contrast, this module is written in pure Python. While slow, it is
useful for applications where compiling a Python C extension is
unfeasible, such as Google's App Engine.

You also may find the geesefly.py code helpful in understanding Skein
and Threefish.

geesefly.py works with Python version 2.5 or later. This includes
version 3 and up.

Skein is a hash function submitted to NIST for their cryptographic hash
algorithm competition. Skein is designed by Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks,
Bruce Schneier, Doug Whiting, Mihir Bellare, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jon
Callas, and Jesse Walker

        ===============
        
        An interpreter for the Shakespeare Programming Language, implemented in
        Python.
        
        What is the Shakespeare Programming Language?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is a programming language
        with source code that looks like Shakespeare's plays. The language is
        Turing complete, so theoretically just as powerful as any other
        language. It's a lot of fun to write but not practical for any large
        projects. More info can be found `on Wikipedia`_.
        
        Note: Shakespeare's actual plays are not valid SPL. SPL does not aim to
        provide backwards compatibility with legacy code written ~400 years ago.
        
        What is this project?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        This is an interpreter I wrote for SPL. It's written in Python. The aim
        is to help programmers better understand how their SPL code is
        executing, with features like REPL and debugging. All previous
        implementations of SPL were cross-compilers, which makes an already
        confusing language even harder to follow.
        
        What state is this project in?
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        I haven't written any tests yet, but it will *probably* run any valid
        SPL program. Features like REPL and debugging are coming Soon :superscript:`TM`.

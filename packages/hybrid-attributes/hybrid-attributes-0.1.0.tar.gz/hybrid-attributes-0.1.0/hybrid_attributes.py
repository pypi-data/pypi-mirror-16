class hybrid_property:
    """
    A `property` like descriptor that gives you the ability to produce values
    when accessed on a class.

    :param fget:
        A function that is called with the instance or class the property is
        accessed on, the result will be returned as attribute.

    :param fset:
        A function that will be called when a value is assigned to the
        attribute on an instance.

    :param fdel:
        A function that is called when the attribute is deleted on an instance.

    :param fcget:
        A function that is called when the attribute is accessed on a class,
        with that class as argument.

        Use this when you need to do something different, depending on whether
        the attribute is accessed on a class or an instance.

    If any of these functions are missing, an :exc:`AttributeError` will be
    raised when a user performs an operation that would otherwise lead to such
    a function being called.

    Instead of passing all arguments directly, you should use decorators to
    define the different functions::

        class SomeClass:
            @hybrid_property
            def attribute(self):
                return self._attribute

            def attribute(cls):
                return 'SomeClass.attribute was accessed'

            @attribute.setter
            def attribute(self, value):
                self._attribute = value

class hybrid_method:
    """
    A descriptor that binds functions to whatever object, class or instance, it
    has been accessed on. This allows you to use a function as an instance
    method and a class method at the same time.

    :param function:
        A function that is bound to the class or instance and returned, when
        the attribute is accessed on a class or instance respectively.

    :param class_function:
        A function that is bound to the class, instead of `function`, when the
        attribute is accessed on a class.

        Use this when you need different behavior when the method is called on
        a class.

    Instead of passing all arguments directly, you should use the `classmethod`
    decorator to define the `class_function`::

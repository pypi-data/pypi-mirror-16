v1.2.5, file-ver: 2.2, 25-May 2016: "Panino/Sandwich" release ("PS")
====================================================================
3nd POST-Panino release.
It contains a bug fix in for creating directories.

It is not accompanied by an ALLINONE archive.


v1.2.4, file-ver: 2.2, 12-May 2016: retracted release
=====================================================
2nd POST-Panino release.
It contains the minor filtering fixes from ``1.2.3`` EXCEPT from
the thermal changes, so as to maintain the model behavior of ``1.2.2``.

It is not accompanied by an ALLINONE archive.


v1.2.3, file-ver: 2.2, 11-May 2016: retracted release
=====================================================
1st POST-Panino release, retracted due to unwanted thermal model changes,
and not accompanied by a ALLINONE archive.

- Thermal model calibration is done filtering out ``dT/dt`` outliers,
- the validation of currents' signs has been relaxed, accepting small errors
  in the inputs, and
- Minor fixes in ``calculate_extended_integration_times`` function, used for
  hot-cycles.



v1.2.2, file-ver: 2.2, 19-Apr 2016: "Panino" release
====================================================
This release contains both key model and software changes; additional capabilities
have been added for the user, namely,

- the capability to accept a **theoretical WLTP** cycle and predict its difference
  from the predicted NEDC (:gh:`186`, :gh:`211`),
- the synchronization ``datasync`` command tool (:gh:`144`, :gh:`218`), and
- improve and explain the `naming-conventions
  <http://co2mpas.io/explanation.html#excel-input-data-naming-conventions>`_
  used in the model and in the input/output excel files (:gh:`215`);

while other changes improve the quality of model runs, namely,

- the introduction of schema to check input values(:gh:`60`, :gh:`80`),
- several model changes improving the handling of real-measurement data-series, and
- several crucial engineering fixes and enhancements on the model-calculations,
  including fixes based on  LAT's assessment of the "O'Snow" release.

The study of this release's results are contained in `these 3 report files
<https://jrcstu.github.io/co2mpas/>`_ for *manual*,  *automatic* and *real* cars,
respectively.


Model-changes
-------------
- :gh:`6`: Confirmed that *co2mpas* results are  reproducible in various setups
  (py2.4, py2.5, with fairly recent combinations of numpy/scipy libraries);
  results are still expected to differ between 32bit-64bit platforms.

Engine model
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- :gh:`110`: Add a function to identify *on_idle* as ``engine_speeds_out > MIN_ENGINE_SPEED``
  and ``gears = 0``, or ``engine_speeds_out > MIN_ENGINE_SPEED`` and ``velocities <= VEL_EPS``.
  When engine is idling, power flowing towards the engine is disengaged, and thus
  engine power is greater than or equal to zero. This correction is applied only for cars
  not equiped with Torque Converter.
- :git:`7340700`: Remove limits from the first step ``co2_params`` optimization.
- :gh:`195`: Enable calibration of ``co2_params`` with vectorial inputs in addition to bag values (in order of priority):
    - ``fuel_consumptions``,
    - ``co2_emissions``,
    - ``co2_normalization_references`` (e.g. engine loads)

  When either ``fuel_consumptions`` or ``co2_emissions`` are available, a direct
  calibration of the co2_emissions model is performed. When those are not available,
  the optimization takes place using the reference normalization signal - if available -
  to redefine the initial solution and then optimize based on the bag values.
- :git:`346963a`: Add ``tau_function`` and make thermal exponent (parameter *t*)
  a function of temperature.
- :git:`9d7dd77`: Remove parameter *trg* from the optimization, keep temperature
  target as defined by the identification phase.
- :git:`079642e`: Use ``scipy.interpolate.InterpolatedUnivariateSpline.derivative``
  for the calculation of ``accelerations``.
- :git:`31f8ccc`: Fix prediction of unreliable rpm taking max gear and idle into account.
- :gh:`169`: Add derivative function for conditioning the temperature signal (resolves resolution issues).
- :gh:`153`: Add ``correct_start_stop_with_gears`` function and flag; default value
  ``True`` for manuals and ``False`` for automatics. The functions *forces* the
  engine to start when gear goes from zero to one, independent of the status of
  the clutch.
- :gh:`47`: Exclude first seconds when the engine is off before performing the
  temperature model calibration.

Electrics model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- :gh:`200`: Fix identification of ``alternator_status_threshold`` and ``charging_statuses``
  for cars with no break eenergy-recuperation-system(BERS). Engine start windows and
  positive alternator currents are now excluded from the calibration.
- :gh:`192`: Add ``alternator_current_threshold`` in the identification of the
  ``charging_statuses``.
- :gh:`149`: Fix identification of the charging status at the beginning of the
  cycle.
- :gh:`149`, :gh:`157`: Fix identification of minimum and maximum state of charge.
- :gh:`149`: Add previous state of charge to the alternator current model calibration.
  Use GradientBoostingRegressor instead of DecisionTreeRegressor, due to over-fitting
  of the later.

Clutch /Torque-converter/AT models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- :gh:`179`: Add lock up mode in the torque converter module.
- :gh:`161`: Apply ``correct_gear_shifts`` function before clearing the fluctuations
  on the ``AT_gear`` model.


IO
--
- :gh:`215`: improve and explain the `naming-conventions
  <http://co2mpas.io/explanation.html#excel-input-data-naming-conventions>`_
  used in the model and in the input/output excel files;
  on model parameters internally and on model parameters used on the Input/Output excel files.

Input
~~~~~
- :gh:`186`, :gh:`211`: Add a ``theoretical_WLTP`` sheet on the inputs. If inputs are provided,
  calculate the additional theoretical cycles on the prediction and add the results
  on the outputs.
- :gh:`60`, :gh:`80`: Add schema to validate shape/type/bounds/etc of input data.
  As an example, the sign of the electric currents is now validated before running
  the model. The user can add the flag ``--soft-validation`` to skip this validation.
- :git:`113b09b`: Fix pinning of ``co2_params``, add capability to fix parameters
  outside predefined limits.
- :gh:`104`: Add ``eco_mode`` flag. Apply ``correct_gear`` function when
  ``eco_mode = True``.
- :gh:`143`: Use electrics from the preconditioning cycle to calculate initial state
  of charge for the WLTP. Default initial state of charge is set equal to 99%.

Output
~~~~~~
- :gh:`198`: Add calculation of *willans factors* for each phase.
- :gh:`164`: Add fuel consumption ``[l/100km]``, total and per subphase, in the output file.
- :gh:`173`: Fix metrics and error messages on the calibration of the clutch model
  (specifically related to calibration failures when data are not of adequate quality).
- :gh:`180`: Remove calibration outputs from the charts. Target signals are not
  presented if not provided by the user.
- :gh:`158`: Add ``apply_f0_correction`` function and report ``correct_f0`` in the
  summary, when the flag for the preconditioning correction is *True* in the input.
- :gh:`168`: Add flag/error message when input data are missing and/or vectors
  have not the same length or contain empty cells.
- :gh:`154`: Add ``calculate_optimal_efficiency`` function. The function returns
  the engine piston speeds and bmep for the calibrated co2 params, when the
  efficiency is maximum.
- :gh:`155`: Add *simple willans factors* calculation on the physical model and
  on the outputs, along with average positive power, average speed when power is
  positive, and average fuel consumption.
- :gh:`160`: Add process bar to the console when running batch simulations.
- :gh:`163`: Add sample logconf-file with all loggers; ``pandalone.xleash.io`` logger silenced bye default.


Jupyter notebooks
-----------------
- :gh:`171`: Fix ``simVehicle.ipynb`` notebook of *O'snow*.

Cmd-line
--------
- :gh:`60`, :gh:`80`: Add flag ``--soft-validation`` to skip schema validation
  of the inputs.
- :gh:`144`, :gh:`145`, :gh:`148`, :gh:`29`, :gh:`218`: Add ``datasync`` command.
  that performs resampling and shifting of the provided signals read from excel-tables.
  Foreseen application is to resync dyno times/velocities with OBD ones as reference.
- :gh:`152`: Add ``--overwrite-cache`` flag.
- : Add ``sa`` command, allowing to perform Sensitivity Analysis
  runs on fuel parameters.
- :gh:`140`, :gh:`162`, :gh:`198`, :git:`99530cb`: Add ``sa`` command that
  builds and run batches with slightly modified values on each run, useful for
  sensitivity-analysis; not fully documented yet.
- :git:`284a7df`: Add output folder option for the model graphs.

Internals
---------
- :gh:`135`: Merge physical calibration and prediction models in a unique physical
  model.
- :gh:`134`: Probable fix for generating dispatcher docs under *Cygwin*.
- :git:`e562551`, :git:`3fcd6ce`: *Dispatcher*: Boost and fix *SubDispatchPipe*,
  fix ``check wait_in`` for sub-dispatcher nodes.
- :gh:`131`: ``test_sub_modules.py`` deleted. Not actually used and difficult
  in the maintenance. To be re-drafted when will be of use.

Documentation
-------------
- improve and explain the `naming-conventions
  <http://co2mpas.io/explanation.html#excel-input-data-naming-conventions>`_
  used in the model and in the input/output excel files (:gh:`215`);

Known limitations
-----------------
- *Model sensitivity*: The sensitivity of CO2MPAS to moderately differing input
  time-series has been tested and found within expected ranges when
  *a single measured WLTP cycle is given as input* on each run - if both
  WLTP H & L cycles are given, even small changes in those paired time-series
  may force the `model-selector <http://co2mpas.io/explanation.html#model-selection>`
  to choose different combinations of calibrated model, thus arriving in
  significantly different fuel-consumption figures between the runs.

v1.1.0-dev1, 18-Dec-2015: "Natale" internal JRC version
=======================================================
Distributed before Christmas and included assessments from LAT.
Model changes reported in "O'snow" release, above.



v1.0.5, 11-Dec 2015: "No more console" release, no model changes
================================================================

- main: Failback to GUI when demo/template/ipynb folder not specified in
  cmdline (prepare for Window's start-menu shortcuts).
- Install from official PyPi repo (simply type ``pip install co2mpas``).
- Add logo.

- ALLINONE:

  - FIX "empty" folder-selection lists bug.
  - Renamed ``cmd-console.bat`` --> ``CONSOLE.bat``.
  - By default store app's process STDOUT/STDERR into logs-files.
  - Add ``INSTALL.bat`` script that creates menu-entries for most common
    CO2MPAS task into *window StartMenu*.
  - Known Issue: Folder-selection dialogs still might appear
    beneath current window sometimes.



v1.0.4, 9-Nov 2015: 3rd public release, mostly model changes
============================================================
Model-changes in comparison to v1.0.1:

- Vehicle/Engine/Gearbox/Transmission:

  - :gh:`13`: If no `r_dynamic` given, attempt to identify it from ``G/V/N`` ratios.
  - :gh:`14`: Added clutch model for correcting RPMs. Power/losses still pending.
  - :gh:`9`: Start-Stop: new model based on the given `start_stop_activation_time`,
    failing back to previous model if not provided. It allows engine stops
    after the 'start_stop_activation_time'.
  - :gh:`21`: Set default value of `k5` equal to `max_gear` to resolve high rpm
    at EUDC deceleration.
  - :gh:`18`: FIX bug in `calculate_engine_start_current` function (zero division).

- Alternator:

  - :gh:`13`: Predict alternator/battery currents if not privded.
  - :gh:`17`: Impose `no_BERS` option when ``has_energy_recuperation == False``.

- A/T:

  - :gh:`28`: Change selection criteria for A/T model
    (``accuracy_score-->mean_abs_error``); not tested due to lack of data.
  - :gh:`34`: Update *gspv* approach (cloud interpolation -> vertical limit).
  - :gh:`35`: Add *eco mode* (MVL) in the A/T model for velocity plateau.
    It selects the highest possible gear.
  - Add option to the input file in order to use a specific A/T model (
    ``specific_gear_shifting=A/T model name``).

- Thermal:

  - :gh:`33`, :gh:`19`: More improvements when fitting of the thermal model.

- Input files:

  - Input-files specify their own version number (currently at `2`).
  - :gh:`9`: Enabled Start-Stop activation time cell.
  - :gh:`25`, :gh:`38`: Add separate sheet for overriding engine's
    fuel-consumption and thermal fitting parameters (trg, t)
    (currently ALL or NONE have to be specified).
  - Added Engine load (%) signal from OBD as input vector.
    Currently not used but will improve significantly the accuracy of the
    cold start model and the execution speed of the program.
    JRC is working on a micro-phases like approach based on this signal.
  - Gears vector not necessary anymore. However providing gears vector
    improves the results for A/Ts and may also lead to better accuracies
    in M/Ts in case the RPM or gear ratios values are not of good quality.
    JRC is still analyzing the issue.

- Output & Summary files:

  - :gh:`23`: Add units and descriptions into output files as a 2nd header-line.
  - :gh:`36`, :gh:`37`: Add comparison-metrics into the summary (target vs output).
    New cmd-line option [--only-summary] to skip saving vehicle-files.

- Miscellaneous:

  - Fixes for when input is 10 Hz.
  - :gh:`20`: Possible to plot workflows of nested models (see Ipython-notebook).
  - Cache input-files in pickles, and read with up-to-date check.
  - Speedup workflow dispatcher internals.


v1.0.3, 13-Oct 2015, CWG release
================================
Still no model-changes in comparison to v1.0.1; released just to distribute
the *all-in-one* archive, provide better instructions, and demonstrate ipython
UI.

- Note that the CO2MPAS contained in the ALLINONE archive is ``1.0.3b0``,
  which does not affect the results or the UI in any way.


v1.0.2, 6-Oct 2015: "Renata" release, unpublished
=================================================
No model-changes, beta-testing "all-in-one" archive for *Windows* distributed
to selected active users only:

- Distributed directly from newly-established project-home on http://co2mpas.io/
  instead of emailing docs/sources/executable (to deal with blocked emails and
  corporate proxies)
- Prepare a pre-populated folder with WinPython + CO2MPAS + Consoles
  for Windows 64bit & 32bit (ALLINONE).
- ALLINONE actually contains ``co2mpas`` command versioned
  as ``1.0.2b3``.
- Add **ipython** notebook for running a single vehicle from the browser
  (see respective Usage-section in the documents) but fails!
- docs:
    - Update Usage instructions based on *all-in-one* archive.
    - Tip for installing behind corporate proxies (thanks to Michael Gratzke),
       and provide link to ``pandalone`` dependency.
    - Docs distributed actually from `v1.0.2-hotfix.0` describing
      also IPython instructions, which, as noted above, fails.

Breaking Changes
----------------
- Rename ``co2mpas`` subcommand: ``examples --> demo``.
- Rename internal package, et all ``compas --> co2mpas``.
- Log timestamps when printing messages.


v1.0.1, 1-Oct 2015: 2nd release
===============================
- Comprehensive modeling with multiple alternative routes depending on
  available data.
- Tested against a sample of 1800 artificially generated vehicles (simulations).
- The model is currently optimized to calculate directly the NEDC CO2 emissions.

Known Limitations
-----------------

#. When data from both WLTP H & L cycles are provided, the model results in
   average NEDC error of ~0.3gCO2/km +- 5.5g/km (stdev) over the 1800 cases
   available to the JRC. Currently no significant systematic errors are observed
   for UDC and EUDC cycles.  No apparent correlations to specific engine or
   vehicle characteristics have been observed in the present release.
   Additional effort is necessary in order to improve the stability of the tool
   and reduce the standard deviation of the error.
#. It has been observed that CO2MPAS tends to underestimate the power
   requirements due to accelerations in WLTP.
   More feedback is needed from real test cases.
#. The current gearbox thermal model overestimates the warm up rate of the
   gearbox.
   The bug is identified and will be fixed in future versions.
#. Simulation runs may under certain circumstances produce different families
   of solutions for the same inputs
   (i.e. for the CO2 it is in the max range of 0.5 g/km).
   The bug is identified and will be fixed in future versions.
#. The calculations are sensitive to the input data provided, and in particular
   the time-series. Time series should originate from measurements/simulations
   that correspond to specific tests from which the input data were derived.
   Mixing time series from different vehicles, tests or cycles may produce
   results that lay outside the expected error band.
#. Heavily quantized velocity time-series may affect the accuracy of the
   results.
#. Ill-formatted input data may NOT produce warnings.
   Should you find a case where a warning should have been raised, we kindly
   ask you to communicate the finding to the developers.
#. Misspelled input-data which are not compulsory, are SILENTLY ignored, and
   the calculations proceed with alternative routes or default-values.
   Check that all your input-data are also contained in the output data
   (calibration files).
#. The A/T module has NOT been tested by the JRC due to the lack of respective
   test-data.
#. The A/T module should be further optimized with respect to the gear-shifting
   method applied for the simulations. An additional error of 0.5-1.5g/km  in
   the NEDC prediction is expected under the current configuration based
   on previous indications.
#. The model lacks a torque-converter / clutch module. JRC requested additional
   feedback on the necessity of such modules.
#. The electric systems module has not been tested with real test data.
   Cruise time series result in quantized squared-shaped signals which are,
   in general, different from analog currents recorded in real tests.
   More test cases are necessary.
#. Currently the electric system module requires input regarding both
   alternator current and battery current in  order to operate. Battery current
   vector can be set to zero but this may reduce the accuracy of the tool.
#. The preconditioning cycle and the respective functions has not been tested
   due to lack of corresponding data.


v0, Aug 2015: 1st unofficial release
====================================
Bugs reported from v0 with their status up to date:

#. 1s before acceleration "press clutch" not applied in WLTP:
   **not fixed**, lacking clutch module, problem not clear in Cruise time series,
   under investigation
#. Strange engine speed increase before and after standstill:
   **partly corrected**, lack of clutch, need further feedback on issue
#. Upshifting seems to be too early, also observed in WLTP, probably
   gearshift point is not "in the middle" of shifting:
   **not fixed**, will be revisited in future versions after comparing with
   cruise results
#. RPM peaks after stop don't match the real ones:
   **pending**, cannot correct based on Cruise inputs
#. Although temperature profile is simulated quite good, the consumption between
   urban and extra-urban part of NEDC is completely wrong:
   **problem partly fixed**, further optimization in UDC CO2 prediction
   will be attempted for future versions.
#. Delta-RCB is not simulated correctly due to a too high recuperation energy
   and wrong application down to standstill:
   **fixed**, the present release has a completely new module for
   calculating electric systems. Battery currents are necessary.
#. Output of more signals for analysis would be necessary:
   **fixed**, additional signals are added to the output file.
   Additional signals could be made available if necessary (which ones?)
#. Check whether a mechanical load (pumps, alternator and climate offset losses)
   as torque-input at the crankshaft is applied:
   **pending**, mechanical loads to be reviewed in future versions after more
   feedback is received.
#. Missing chassis dyno setting for warm-up delta correction:
   **unclear** how this should be treated (as a correction inside the tool or
   as a correction in the input data)
#. SOC Simulation: the simulation without the SOC input is much too optimistic
   in terms of recuperation / providing the SOC signals does not work as
   intended with the current version:
   **fixed**, please review new module for electrics.
#. The gearshift module 0.5.5 miscalculates gearshifts:
   **partially fixed**, the module is now included in CO2MPAS v1 but due to lack
   in test cases has not been further optimized.
#. Overestimation of engine-power in comparison to measurements:
   **indeterminate**, in fact this problem is vehicle specific. In the test-cases
   provided to the JRC both higher and lower power demands are experienced.
   Small deviations are expected to have a limited effect on the final calculation.
   What remains open is the amount of power demand over WLTP transient phases
   which so far appears to be systematically underestimated in the test cases
   available to the JRC.
#. Overestimation of fuel-consumption during cold start:
   **partially fixed**, cold start over UDC has been improved since V0.
#. CO2MPAS has a pronounced fuel cut-off resulting in zero fuel consumption
   during over-runs:
   **fixed**, indeed there was a bug in the cut-off operation associated to
   the amount of power flowing back to the engine while braking.
   A limiting function is now applied. Residual fuel consumption is foreseen
   for relatively low negative engine power demands (engine power> -2kW)
#. A 5 second start-stop anticipation should not occur in the case of A/T
   vehicles: **fixed**.

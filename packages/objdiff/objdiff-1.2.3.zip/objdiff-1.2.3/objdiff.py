"""ObjDiff: Generate a list of commands/delta to go from oe object to another

Objdiff provides 4 types of action that can be applied to an object to transtion
it to another object. one of these is internal and can be ignored

 * deleted
 * added
 * modified
 * equal (internal)

These are all namedtuples and provide the paths and values required for the 
transition

Diffing lists and dictonaries is handled diffrently and broken out into 2 functions
named diff_list and diff_dict. These provide 'shallow' diffing of objects. In the
case of dictonaries this is limited to only keys, while lists will diff the values
in a shallow fashion

The main (deep) diffing function is 'obj_diff', this takes 2 objects and provides
a stream of commands to apply via iteration

A utility is provided if this module is executed as a comamnd to show off the 
delta functionality and will diff 2 yaml files provided on the command line. The
src repository for this module provides such example yaml files

    on SpiNNaker machines.

    Once constructed the server starts a background thread
    (:py:attr:`._server_thread`, :py:meth:`._run`) which implements the main
    server logic and handles communication with clients, monitoring of
    asynchronous board control events (e.g. board power-on completion) and
    watches the config file for changes. All members of this object are assumed
    to be accessed only from this thread while it is running. The thread is
    stopped, and its completion awaited by calling :py:meth:`.stop_and_join`,
    stopping the server.

    The server uses a :py:class:`~spalloc_server.Controller` object to
    implement scheduling, allocation and machine management functionality. This
    object is :py:mod:`pickled <pickle>` when the server shuts down in order to
    preserve the state of all managed machines (e.g. allocated jobs etc.).

    To allow the interruption of the server thread on asynchronous events from
    the Controller a :py:func:`~socket.socketpair` (:py:attr:`._notify_send`
    and :py:attr:`._notify_send`) is used which monitored allong with client
    connections and config file changes.

    A number of callable commands are implemented by the server in the form of
    a subset of the :py:class:`.Server`'s methods indicated by the
    :py:func:`._command` decorator. These may be called by a client by sending
    a line ``{"command": "...", "args": [...], "kwargs": {...}}``. If the
    function throws an exception, the client is disconnected. If the function
    returns, it is packed as a JSON line ``{"return": ...}``.

        The 'other parameters' enumerated below may be used to further restrict
        what machines the job may be allocated onto.

        Jobs for which no suitable machines are available are immediately
        destroyed (and the reason given).

        Once a job has been created, it must be 'kept alive' by a simple
        watchdog_ mechanism. Jobs may be kept alive by periodically calling the
        :py:meth:`.job_keepalive` command or by calling any other job-specific
        command. Jobs are culled if no keep alive message is received for
        ``keepalive`` seconds. If absolutely necessary, a job's keepalive value
        may be set to None, disabling the keepalive mechanism.

        .. _watchdog: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer

        Once a job has been allocated some boards, these boards will be
        automatically powered on and left unbooted ready for use.

        Parameters
        ----------
        owner : str
            **Required.** The name of the owner of this job.
        keepalive : float or None
            *Optional.* The maximum number of seconds which may elapse between
            a query on this job before it is automatically destroyed. If None,
            no timeout is used. (Default: 60.0)

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        machine : str or None
            *Optional.* Specify the name of a machine which this job must be
            executed on. If None, the first suitable machine available will be
            used, according to the tags selected below. Must be None when tags
            are given. (Default: None)
        tags : [str, ...] or None
            *Optional.* The set of tags which any machine running this job must
            have. If None is supplied, only machines with the "default" tag
            will be used. If machine is given, this argument must be None.
            (Default: None)
        min_ratio : float
            The aspect ratio (h/w) which the allocated region must be 'at least
            as square as'. Set to 0.0 for any allowable shape, 1.0 to be
            exactly square. Ignored when allocating single boards or specific
            rectangles of triads.
        max_dead_boards : int or None
            The maximum number of broken or unreachable boards to allow in the
            allocated region. If None, any number of dead boards is permitted,
            as long as the board on the bottom-left corner is alive (Default:
            None).
        max_dead_links : int or None
            The maximum number of broken links allow in the allocated region.
            When require_torus is True this includes wrap-around links,
            otherwise peripheral links are not counted.  If None, any number of
            broken links is allowed. (Default: None).
        require_torus : bool
            If True, only allocate blocks with torus connectivity. In general
            this will only succeed for requests to allocate an entire machine
            (when the machine is otherwise not in use!). Must be False when
            allocating boards. (Default: False)

            ``board_chip`` the coordinates of the chip, (x, y), within its

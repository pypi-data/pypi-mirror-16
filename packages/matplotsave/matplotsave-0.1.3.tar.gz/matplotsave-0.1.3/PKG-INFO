Description: Intro
        =====
        
        A library of functions (just one at the moment) to streamline the saving
        and exporting of matplotlib plots as images and whatnot.
        
        I wrote it because I was spending a lot of time creating and saving
        plots in another project of mine and wanted to automate it.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
        
            from matplotsave import pltsave
        
            xs = list(range(10))
            ys = [i**2 for i in xs]
            with pltsave("myplot.png") as (fig,ax):
                ax.plot(xs,ys)
        
        This will export the plot to ``myplot.png`` painlessly after you are
        given the chance to actually plot some data.
        
        Because the ``pltsave`` context manager returns the fig and ax objects
        the entire matplotlib api si still accessible.

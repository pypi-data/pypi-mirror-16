Biff (``biff``)
***************

Biff is a Python package for evaluating basis function expansions of mass
densities and gravitational potentials using the Self-Consistent Field (SCF)
method of [Hernquist & Ostriker (1992)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/171025).

This is largely based on the formalism described in Hernquist & Ostriker (1992)
but using the notation of Lowing et al. (2011). The radial basis functions are
taken to be Hernquist functions and the angular functions are spherical
harmonics.

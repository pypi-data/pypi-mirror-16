Description: The sdpt3glue package serves as glue code to allow semidefinite programming (SDP problems modeled using Cvxpy to be solved using the Matlab-compatible solver SDPT3.
        
        SDPT3 can be used in a number of ways:
        
        - on an installed copy of Matlab with SDPT3,
        
        - on an installed copy of Octave with SDPT3,
        
        - using a Docker image of Octave with SDPT3,
        
        - by sending the problem to the NEOS server and retrieving the answer.

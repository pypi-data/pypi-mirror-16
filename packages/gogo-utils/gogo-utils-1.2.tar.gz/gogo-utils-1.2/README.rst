Gogo-utils
----------

gogo-utils is a utility library that generates a service name convention based on a repo url. The
library is mainly used to ensure that an application is able to easily know the path to a service
it may need.

.. code:: python

    from gogoutils import Parser, Generator

    url = 'https://github.com/gogoair/test.git'
    project, repo = Parser(url).parse_url()

    # a way to customize based on your conventions
    my_formats = {
        'jenkins_job_name': '{project}-{repo}-master',
        'app': 'app-{project}{repo}',
    }

    info = Generator(project, repo, 'dev', formats=my_formats)

    info.jenkins()
    > {'name': 'gogoair-test-master'}

    info.app_name()
    > app-gogoairtest

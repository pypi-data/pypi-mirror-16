README for pwclip - http://packages.python.org/pwclip/
======================================================

pwclip is a small tool to put some hash, generated via (yubikey)
challenge-response on any slot of the first yubikey found on system.
So far Linux, Windows and OSX is supported by using python's tk library
to create password input window. If no text is inserted there will be a
challenge-response for that empty string. The appropriate response is saved
only for 3 seconds by default but the command-line tool supports the input
of any integer number which is then used as timer.

Install
-------

pwclip requires the "xsel" package on Linux-Systems to have access to
    copy/paste buffers. on Windows-Systems the libusb package must be
    integrated to python3 as "usb-backend" (see libusb documentation for that)

* https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/xsel/
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/

If you are on a debian like System the installation of the dependencies
    should work like the following:

:~$ apt-get install python3-yubico python3-usb python3-tk

Otherwise pip might be used, like the following:

:~$ pip3 install yubico usb tk

What is quicklogging
---------------------

*quicklogging* is a Python :py:mod:`logging` wrapper to 

    * remove a bit of logging boilerplate,
    * redirect print output.

``quicklogging`` transparently provides a logger with a name relevant 
to the code at hand: 

.. important:: 

    The name of the logger is the name of the module making the call.


For instance, if you log from ``project/models/chair.py``, your logger will be named ``project.models.chair``.

This is a very important feature:

*Advantage #1 of this naming scheme* 

        the *configuration* of the :py:class:`logging.Logger` s and handlers is much 
        easier —muting, changing verbosity for a particular piece of code etc

*Advantage #2*

        we can provide a :py:func:`quicklogging.catch_prints` and a :py:func:`quicklogging.warn_prints`  functionality to catch calls 
        to print() from specific modules (typically: the module you're editing).

Requirements
--------------

Python versions
................

According to travis-ci_ : 

* Python 3.5: ok
* Python 3.5-dev: ok
* Python nightly: ok

Cannot test, but should work because I don't know of API changes:

* Python 2.7: *testing* NOT ok (Python 2.7 doesn't have :py:class:`importlib.abc.SourceLoader`
 
Libs required
.................

None ! unless you're running the tests (then you need stringimporter_).
.
So I've got this easy badge: |requirements|.

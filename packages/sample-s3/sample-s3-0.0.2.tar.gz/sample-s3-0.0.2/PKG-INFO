Description: This utility allows you to extsact sample lines from a CSV hosted on Amazon S3.
        The use case is that you have a really large CSV on S3 that you want to look at,
        but you do not want to download the entire file.
        
        What it does is grab random bytes from the key and assemble unbroken lines from
        the file to create as sample.
        
        The use case is for determining a file format, file contents, etc. See the
        cognoscenti project for an example. (Um, this doesn't exist yet. Check back later.)
        
        _Usage: sample.py [OPTIONS]_
        
            Options:
              --bucket TEXT             bucket name
              --key TEXT                key name
              --headers / --no-headers  Include headers in output. Defaults to include.
              -d, --delimiter TEXT      File delimiter. Defaults to ','
              -l, --lines INTEGER       How many sample lines do you want? Defaults to 1000.
              --help                    Show this message and exit.
        
        Allows you to indicate the number of lines you hope to recieve. It will
        grab 1000 lines by default.

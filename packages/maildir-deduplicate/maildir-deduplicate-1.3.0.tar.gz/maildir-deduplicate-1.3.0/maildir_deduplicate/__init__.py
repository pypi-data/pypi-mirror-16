# false positive. Note that the headers are not counted towards this threshold,
# because many headers can be added by mailing list software such as mailman,
# or even by the process of sending the mail through various MTAs - one copy
# could have been stored by the sender's MUA prior to sending, without any
# Received: headers, and another copy could be reflected back via a Cc-to-self
# mechanism or mailing list server. But this threshold has to be at least large

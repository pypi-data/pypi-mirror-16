## Contributing to quay client

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

### Working with the code

Now that you have an issue you want to fix, enhancement to add, or documentation to improve, you need to learn how to work with GitHub.
We use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

Finally, commit your changes to your local repository with an explanatory message, quay client uses a convention for commit message prefixes.
Here are some common prefixes along with general guidelines for when to use them:
 * ENH: Enhancement, new functionality
 * BUG: Bug fix
 * DOC: Additions/updates to documentation
 * TST: Additions/updates to tests
 * BLD: Updates to the build process/scripts
 * PERF: Performance improvement
 * CLN: Code cleanup
 * NOBUILD: special tag to skip test & build

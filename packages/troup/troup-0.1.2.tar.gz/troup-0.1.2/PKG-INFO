        Take control of your home grid.
        
        * run applications across multiple computers and platforms transparently, just as you would from your terminal. The application will run on the most appropriate node, determined by algorithm.
        * run tasks (run code fragments or processes) transparently across the system. The tasks can be either automatically assigned to a node, similar as the applications; or they can be assigned explicitly to a node.

   :alt: Build Status

A module that implements the CRC8 hash algorithm for Python 2 and 3.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install crc8

Or copy the `crc8.py
<https://github.com/niccokunzmann/crc8/blob/master/crc8.py>`__ file somewhere
where you can import it.

Usage
-----

The ``crc8`` class has the same interface as the hash functions in the 
`hashlib module
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html>`__.

Example:

.. code:: python

    import crc8
    hash = crc8.crc8()
    hash.update(b'123')
    assert hash.hexdigest() == 'c0'

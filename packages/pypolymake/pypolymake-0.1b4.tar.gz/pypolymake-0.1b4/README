pypolymake
==========

What is it?
-----------

The Python module pypolymake provides wrappers for `polymake
<https://polymake.org/doku.php>`_.

The language has been kept as close as possible as the original. The
following polymake construction::

    polytope> $c = cube(5);
    polytope > print $c->F_VECTOR;
    32 80 80 40 10

is translated in Python as::

    >>> from polymake import *
    >>> c = cube(5)
    >>> c.F_VECTOR()
    (32, 80, 80, 40, 10)

The library is currently under development. Many things are not working and are
likely to cause segmentation fault!

Installation and source code
----------------------------

To install pypolymake you need polymake in version 3.0 or later together with
its header files.

The simplest way to install the package is to use::

    $ pip install pypolymake --user

(the `--user` argument make the installation in your home directory and can be
omitted if you have write access to your system).  Alternatively,
you can download (or clone) the source repository at

    https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake

and then run in that directory

    $ python setup.py install --user

If polymake headers or libraries are installed in a non standard location you
may need to set the environment variables CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS. For example,
on OS X, you need to update LDFLAGS as::

    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/ $LDFLAGS"
    $ python setup.py install --user

You might also need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH before starting Python if the shared
library of polymake (libpolymake.so) is not in a standard directory.

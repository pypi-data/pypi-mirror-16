        Buttshock Project Goals
        -----------------------
        
        If you're going to shock yourself in the butt (or other places) for
        sexual pleasure, don't you want to be able to know exactly what and
        how you're doing it? Even if you can't understand it, wouldn't it be
        nice for people that do to have access to the knowledge and data they
        need to make sure things are safe? Why is the best encryption open
        source, but electrostim toys are closed?
        
        The Buttshock project exists to reverse engineer and document
        eletrostim devices so that any developer that wants to control their
        devices can, via their own code.
        
        Some of the goals of this project include:
        
        - Documenting the communications protocols (serial or otherwise)
        - Reverse engineering the firmware (where possible)
        - Mapping the circuit boards and creating schematics
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pip install buttshock --upgrade
        
        Package is also available on PyPi at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/buttshock
        
        Python Implementation Details
        -----------------------------
        
        This is a python implementation of the RS-232 control protocol for the
        ErosTek ET-312 electrostimulation box.
        
        Documentation of the link cable, protocol, and other information is at:
        
        https://buttshock.com/doc/et312
        
        This library was developed and tested using a ET-312B running v1.6
        firmware. The ET-232 and 2B libraries are untested, but please let us
        know if you've used them and they do/don't work!
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        buttshock-py requires the pyserial library if you want to actually
        connect via serial. However, it can pass packets for each box over
        whatever medium you like.

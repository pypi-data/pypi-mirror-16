        Introduction
        ============
        The LUE Python package allows you to perform I/O to the `LUE Scientific Database`, which is an `HDF5`_ binary data format.
        
        The LUE database lets you efficiently store huge amounts of attribute values of huge amounts of objects. These objects can be located in time and/or in space, and the attribute values can be n-dimensional values. The LUE database is `developed <https://github.com/pcraster/lue>`_ by the `PCRaster`_ R&D Team, to be useful in the domain of agent-based and field-based modeling. But the data format is general enough to allow it to be used in other domains as well.

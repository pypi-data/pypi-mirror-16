          -u JIRA_URL, --jira-url JIRA_URL
                                The url Jira is located at including http://
          -r REPO_ROOT, --repo-root REPO_ROOT
                                The location of the git repo, must have a .git inside

          --project-name PROJECT_NAME
                                The name of the project to help generate the label
          --build-number BUILD_NUMBER

          --development         Pass flag if using for development
          --production          Pass flag if using for production
          ```

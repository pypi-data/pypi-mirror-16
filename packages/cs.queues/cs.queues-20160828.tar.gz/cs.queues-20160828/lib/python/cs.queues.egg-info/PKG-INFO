Description: Queue subclasses and ducktypes.
        -------------------------------
        
        Presents:
        
        * IterableQueue and IterablePriorityQueue, Queues with the iterator protocol instead of .get(). Prospective users should also consider iter(Queue.get,sentinel), which plainly I did not.
        
        * Channel, a zero storage message passing object.
        
        * NullQueue, a .puttable object that discards its inputs.
        
        * TimerQueue, a queue for submtting jobs to run at specific times without creating many Timer threads.
        
        * PushQueue, a Queue ducktype which queues a function on .put, whose iterable result is put onto an output Queue.

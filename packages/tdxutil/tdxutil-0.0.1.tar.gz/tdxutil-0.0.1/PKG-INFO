Description: # Welcome to tdxutil
        
        This project grew out of a desire to stop rewriting the same functions in
        a `utils` module of every new package.
        
        Mostly it remains that way - very simple functions. The only exceptions
        are the `wrapping` and `reflection` modules, which deal with decorators
        and function-call-inspection tools that I've wanted to use on a few occasions
        but never took the time to implement.
        
        More documentation to come, hopefully after unit tests :)

# Welcome to tdxutil

This project grew out of a desire to stop rewriting the same functions in
a `utils` module of every new package.

Mostly it remains that way - very simple functions. The only exceptions
are the `wrapping` and `reflection` modules, which deal with decorators
and function-call-inspection tools that I've wanted to use on a few occasions
but never took the time to implement.

More documentation to come, hopefully after unit tests :)

        ## An Introduction
        
        The [Official MyAnimeList API](http://myanimelist.net/modules.php?go=api) needs lots of work and is pretty annoying to use. Here are some of the many issues:
        * Some of the documentation is just straight up incorrect (perhaps it was correct sometime ago).
        * There are MySQL bugs on MAL's end that must be circumvented.
        * There are severe limitations in what the API allows you to do, forcing the programmer's hand to write ugly scraping code.
        * Some of the ways to do simple things like updating an anime on a user's list requires an esoteric knowledge of MAL URLs/queries that are no where on the documentation.
        * The Official MAL API fails to provide consistent behavior.
        	- e.g. When sending too many requests, the Official MAL API has unpredictable
        	behavior.
        
        Work and/or further development on it seems like a lost cause, since the developer(s) have far more pressing concerns with the site.
        
        This API aims to provide an easy to use Python API that wraps around MAL's
        REST-API so that you don't have to experience any headaches.
        
        Name inspired by [Horo/Holo](http://myanimelist.net/character/7373/Holo) from [Spice and Wolf](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2966/Ookami_to_Koushinryou?q=Spice%20and%20Wolf).
        
        API inspired by other attempts (which made their own REST API wrapper, while this one uses a pure Python implementation), such as [crobert22](https://github.com/croberts22)'s [Railgun](https://github.com/croberts22/railgun) and [chuyeow](https://github.com/chuyeow)'s [myanimelist-api](https://github.com/chuyeow/myanimelist-api).
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install spice_mal
        ```
        
        ## Here's how to use it (WIP)
        
        ```python
        import spice_mal as spice
        
        def main():
        	creds = spice.load_auth_from_file('auth') #or spice.init_auth(username, pw)
        	search_results = spice.search('Spice and Wolf', spice.get_medium('anime'))
        	print(results[0].title) # > Ookami to Koushinryou
        	saw_id = results[0].id # > 2966
        	
        	#mal sees everything as anime or manga, so novels are considered manga.
        	saw_novel = spice.search_id(saw_id, spice.get_medium('manga'))
        	print(saw_novel.title) # > Ookami to Koushinryou
        	print(saw_novel.chapters) # > 0
        	print(saw_novel.volumes) # > 18
        	
        	#get a fresh anime data object to fill in, and then push to your list
        	saw_data = spice.get_blank(spice.get_medium('anime'))
        	saw_data.episodes = 10 #you've watched 10 eps
        	saw_data.status = spice.get_status('watching') #you're still watching
        	saw_data.score = 9 #your rating
        	saw_data.tags = ['Holo is the best.'] #tags
        	#there are many other fields you can fill in, but this is enough.
        	spice.update(saw_data, saw_id, spice.get_medium('anime')) #update your list.
        
        	your_list = spice.get_list(spice.get_medium('anime'))
        	other_anime_list = spice.get_list(spice.get_medium('anime'), 'Pickleplatter')
        	
        	print(your_list.avg_score()) # > mean 
        	print(your_list.p_var()) # > variance
        	print(your_list.get_num_status(spice.get_status_num('watching')))
        	print(your_list.compatibility(other_anime_list)) # > compatibility score
        
        ```
        
        ## What's left
        This API is far from done. Here's what is left to be done:
        * ~~Refactor code structure to provide cohesive interface for the API to be used from.~~
        	- e.g. ~~AnimeData and MangaData objects require a separate import as of now.~~
        * Set up pip package for easy install.
        * ~~Add functionality for animelist statistics and data.~~
        	- ~~There is no such functionality in the Official MAL API, but this is important to have.~~

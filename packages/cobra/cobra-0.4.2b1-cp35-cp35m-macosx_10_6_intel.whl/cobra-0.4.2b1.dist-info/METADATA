COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used
for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes. COBRApy is a constraint-based modeling package that is designed to
accommodate the biological complexity of the next generation of COBRA models and
provides access to commonly used COBRA methods, such as flux balance analysis,
flux variability analysis, and gene deletion analyses.

To install, please follow the [instructions](INSTALL.md).

The documentation is browseable online at
[readthedocs](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
and can also be
[downloaded](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cobrapy/downloads/).

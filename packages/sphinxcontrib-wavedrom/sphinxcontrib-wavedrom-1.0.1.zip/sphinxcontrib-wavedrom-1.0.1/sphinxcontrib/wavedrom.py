"""
This sphinx extension allows the user to include wavedrom waveform diagrams 
in its documentation, by just using the textual description, rather than 
generating and including static images.

At the moment, the extension doesn't generate static images itself, but
relies on the js scripts provided by wavedrom to generate them in the browser.

By default, the script will use the js hosted on the wavedrom servers. 
This is the easiest setup, but relies on an active internet connection and a 
stable hosting on wavedrom's side. In the near future, I aim to add the possibility
to use a local version of the js scripting, to allow for offline reading.

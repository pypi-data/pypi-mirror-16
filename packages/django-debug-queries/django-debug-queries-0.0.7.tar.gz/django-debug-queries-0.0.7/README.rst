This package provides a simple context manager for Django applications
that will output the SQL queries caused by a block of code to standard
output.

(To pre-empt a common question: Django Debug Toolbar lets you see the
queries caused by HTTP requests to your application, but often I want to
track down the queries that are used in a management command or some
other context than making requests in your browser; the ``show_queries``
context manager in this package helps in those other situations.)

.. warning:: Please be aware that DEBUG will be set to True
             throughout the block (and restored to its previous
             value afterwards), so this shouldn't be used in
             production, for example.

If you have sqlparse installed, then the SQL will be pretty-printed to
make them easier to read, so I'd recommend that you also do:

::

    pip install sqlparse

Example
~~~~~~~

::

    from django_debug_queries import show_queries

    ...

        with show_queries():
            people = list(Person.objects.filter(date_of_birth__gt="2000-01-01") \
                .values('id', 'legal_name'))
            sessions = list(ParliamentarySession.objects.all())

This might output the following to standard output:

::


    --===--
    Number of queries: 2
      Query 0 (taking 0.003):
        SELECT "core_person"."id",
               "core_person"."legal_name"
        FROM "core_person"
        WHERE "core_person"."date_of_birth" > '2000-01-01'
        ORDER BY "core_person"."sort_name" ASC
      Query 1 (taking 0.005):
        SELECT "core_parliamentarysession"."id",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."created",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."updated",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."start_date",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."end_date",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."house_id",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."position_title_id",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."mapit_generation",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."name",
               "core_parliamentarysession"."slug"
        FROM "core_parliamentarysession"
        ORDER BY "core_parliamentarysession"."start_date" ASC
    End of query output.

Other options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Long query strings can take a long time to pretty-print using sqlparse,
so by default SQL that is longer that 2048 characters is not formatted;
you can adjust that limit with the optional ``sqlparse_character_limit``
parameter, e.g.:

::

        with show_queries(sqlparse_character_limit=8192):
            ...

If you are using multiple databases in your Django application, you can
tell this to use a particular database with the optional ``db_alias``
parameter, e.g.

::

        with show_queries(db_alias='my_other_db'):
            ...

Description: DJANGO MYSQLDUMP
        ----------------
        
        Simple dump tool to automate dumps, for example during automated deploys
        Works with older django versions (< 1.3)
        
        Dumps the default database when it is mysql. 
        Preferably to be triggered by a cron job, or launchd on macosx.
        Could also be triggered by Scheduler on Windows, but we're not using Windows, are we?
        
        Produces a timestamped dump which could be used for rollback.
        Takes app specific settings, to be found in settings.py
        
        # Required settings
        # -----------------
        APP_LOGS_ROOT
        APP_DUMP_PATH
        
        # Optional settings
        # -----------------
        APP_MYSQLDUMP_PATH = 'usr/bin' #(path to mysqldump, default is /usr/bin)
        APP_DB_ROLLBACKS = 60 #(no. of rollbacks, default 60)

        Pygerrit2 provides a simple interface for clients to interact with
        `Gerrit Code Review`_ via the REST API.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        Pygerrit2 is compatible with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.  Support for Python 3
        is experimental.
        
        Pygerrit2 depends on the `requests`_ library.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install pygerrit2, simply::
        
            $ pip install pygerrit2
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        This simple example shows how to get the user's open changes. Authentication
        to Gerrit is done via HTTP Digest authentication, using an explicitly given
        username and password::
        
            >>> from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
            >>> from pygerrit2.rest import GerritRestAPI
            >>> auth = HTTPDigestAuth('username', 'password')
            >>> rest = GerritRestAPI(url='http://review.example.net', auth=auth)
            >>> changes = rest.get("/changes/?q=owner:self%20status:open")
        
        Note that is is not necessary to add the ``/a/`` prefix on the endpoint
        URLs. This is automatically added when the API is instantiated with an
        authentication object.
        
        If the user's HTTP username and password are defined in the ``.netrc``
        file::
        
            machine review.example.net login MyUsername password MyPassword
        
        then it is possible to authenticate with those credentials::
        
            >>> from pygerrit2.rest import GerritRestAPI
            >>> from pygerrit2.rest.auth import HTTPDigestAuthFromNetrc
            >>> url = 'http://review.example.net'
            >>> auth = HTTPDigestAuthFromNetrc(url=url)
            >>> rest = GerritRestAPI(url=url, auth=auth)
            >>> changes = rest.get("/changes/?q=owner:self%20status:open")
        
        Note that the HTTP password is not the same as the SSH password. For
        instructions on how to obtain the HTTP password, refer to Gerrit's
        `HTTP upload settings`_ documentation.
        
        Refer to the `example`_ script for a full working example.

This is a development cron daemon. It's intended as a debugging tool when
developing anything cron based where it would be difficult to use normal cron or
when cron runs must be modified for the dev environment.

For example, I have a django project that uses cron to run periodic tasks. The
crontab is in the source tree so it can be managed and deployed with the code.
While doing dev work, I need to run the cron tasks locally and modify the path
of the commands. The crontab looks something like:

     # devcron delete_str /usr/local/bin/
     * * * * * /usr/local/bin/update-stats.py && \
               /usr/local/bin/publish-stats.py

That works normally on the production server and when I'm working, I run:

`devcron.py my-crontab`

and it will run update-stats.py in the working directory (my development tree)
once a minute.



You can install with:

`pip install devcron`

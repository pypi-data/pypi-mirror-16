Description: TodoMVC based on Morepath and Cerebral
        ======================================
        
        Cerebral TodoMVC with a Morepath REST backend.
        
        Morepath backend
        ----------------
        
        The backend ist based on `morepath_reactredux <https://github.com/morepath/morepath_reactredux>`_.
        You find the code of the backend in the server directory.
        
        From inside the project directory create a clean Python environment with
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest>`_ and activate it::
        
          $ virtualenv env
          $ source env/bin/activate
        
        After this you can install the package including dependencies using::
        
          $ env/bin/pip install -e .
        
        Once that is done you can start the server::
        
          $ env/bin/run-app
        
        You can go to http://localhost:5000 to see the UI.
        
        For installing the test suite and running the tests use::
        
          $ env/bin/pip install -e '.[test]'
          $ env/bin/py.test
        
        
        TodoMVC JS bundle
        -----------------
        
        We use the TodoMVC example from Cerebral,
        which is based on Baobab, React and Cerebral:
        
        https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral-todomvc
        
        JavaScript code is in the `client` subdirectory. To rebuild the bundle you
        need to install the JS dependencies (listed in package.json). Run::
        
          $ npm install
        
        to install them. Then run::
        
          $ webpack
        
        To rebuild the bundle after changing it.

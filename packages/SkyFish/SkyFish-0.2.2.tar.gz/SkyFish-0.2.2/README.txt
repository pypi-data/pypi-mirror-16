# SkyFish Python SDK

Official Skyfish Python SDK for merchant inventory integrations.

Skyfish requires inventory sync for merchants to be able to use it effectively in the chat window. This SDK wraps the required endpoints, making it easier for merchant's tech team to implement it. All you have to do is attach it to your inventory's Create-Read-Update-Delete Handler.

The use of the SDK requires the token that is granted during the login process. To learn more on how to login please refer to the [authorization documentation](http://docs.skyfish.id/authorization/)

## Setup

``` easy_install skyfish-py ```

or

``` pip install skyfish-py ```

## Usage

### Initialization
To start using you will need the following components when you initialize the SDK:

* `email` : This is the merchant email you use during registration.
* `passport_id` : This is the passport_id you receive after registering
* `token` : This is the token you receive from the login process.
* `client_key`: This is the client_key you receive after registering.
* `request_module` : This is the dependency that you need to inject. For this use case we tend to use [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) but you can use whatever library you think is best as long as it follows the same abstraction.
* `is_production`: This is the marker of environment being used. If in production, set this to be True, this parameter is optional

to start using initialize the SDK using the above parameters:

```
"""
This example uses the requests module as http request library
"""
import requests
from skyfish import SkyFishSDK


sky = SkyFishSDK(
                email='somerandomemail@somerandomemail.com',
                passport_id='somepassportid',
                token='somerandomtokenfromloginprocess',
                client_key='somerandomclientkey',
                request_module=requests)
```

That's it and you're set to start integrating.

## Product Management

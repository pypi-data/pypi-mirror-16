This repository demonstrates how to make a project pip installable, write a Python module in C++ and use scikit-learn, keras and spearmint.

In order to run some of the code, one has to define the bash variable learningml. In my case it is

export learningml="/Users/weisser/MIT_Dropbox/MIT/Research/learningml/learningml"

This has to be sourced.

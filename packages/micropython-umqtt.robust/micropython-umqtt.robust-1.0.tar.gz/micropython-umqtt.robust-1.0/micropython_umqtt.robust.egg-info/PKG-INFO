Description: umqtt.robust
        ============
        
        umqtt is a simple MQTT client for MicroPython. (Note that it uses some
        MicroPython shortcuts and doesn't work with CPython). It consists of
        two submodules: umqtt.simple and umqtt.robust. umqtt.robust is built
        on top of umqtt.simple and adds auto-reconnect facilities for some of
        networking errors.

Description: serializable
        ============
        
        Base class with serialization methods for user-defined Python objects
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Classes which inherit from ``Serializable`` are given default
        implementations of ``to_json``, ``from_json``, ``__reduce__`` (for
        pickling), and other serialization helpers.
        
        Your derived class must:
        
        -  provide a user-defined ``to_dict()`` method which returns a
           dictionary whose keys are strings and whose values are all primitive
           serializable types (list, dict, int, str, &c).
        
        -  The keys of the dictionary returned by ``to_dict()`` must match the
           arguments to the ``__init__`` of your class.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        -  Nested objects must also inherit from ``Serializable`` and must be
           manually converted to serializable types in ``to_dict()`` and then
           reconstructed by overriding the class method
           ``_reconstruct_nested_objects``.
        
        -  Functions defined at the top level of a module can be converted to
           primtive types with ``function_to_serializable_representation``, but
           this helper will fail for methods.

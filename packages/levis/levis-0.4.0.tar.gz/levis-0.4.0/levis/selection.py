"""Selection strategies for genetic algorithms.


Contents
--------

:ProportionateGA:
    Proportionate selection scores all chromosomes in each generation and gives
    more fit chromosomes an advantage in selection for reproduction that is
    proportionate to the fitness scores. For instance, a chromosome with a score
    of 10 will be twice as likely to be selected as one with a score of 5.

    With proportionate selection comes the advantages of convergence in fewer
    generations and elitism, ensuring the best members of a generation live on
    unchanged to the next.

:ScalingProportionateGA:
    This is proportionate selection, but one that scales the reproductive
    advantage by using the minimum non-zero score as the lower end of a scale. If
    the highest score in a generation is 100 and the lowest is 30, then scores
    will be scaled from 1 to 70 to increase the advantage of more fit
    individuals.

:TournamentGA:
    Tournament selection scores a random sample of the population and always
    promotes the member with the best score for reproduction. Elitism is moot,
    since there is no guarantee that the highest scored members of a generation
    are the most fit, but convergence can come in fewer CPU cycles when the
    fitness function is expensive, and it has the advantage of being agnostic to
    the scale of scores.

:ElitistGA:
    Elitism ensures the survival of the absolute fittest chromosomes between
    generations to prevent regression. This is not a selection mechanism by
    itself, but augments one of the strategies above.

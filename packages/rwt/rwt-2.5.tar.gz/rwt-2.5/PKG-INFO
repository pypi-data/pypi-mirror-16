Description: rwt
        ===
        
        /ruːt/
        
        RWT (Run With This) provides on-demand dependency resolution.
        
        - Allows declaration of dependencies at runtime.
        - Downloads missing dependencies and makes their packages available for import.
        - Installs packages to a special staging location such that they're not installed after the process exits.
        - Keeps a cache of such packages for reuse.
        - Supersedes installed packages when required.
        - Re-uses the pip tool chain for package installation and pkg_resources for working set management.
        
        RWT is not intended to solve production dependency management, but does aim to address the other, one-off scenarios around dependency management:
        
        - build setup
        - test runners
        - just in time script running
        - interactive development
        
        RWT is a compliment to Pip and Virtualenv and Setuptools, intended to more
        readily address the on-demand needs and supersede some
        features like ``setup_requires``.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        The project is currently still experimental and liable
        to undergo substantial revision. Do feel free to try
        it out and give your feedback at the project page.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - as script launcher
        - as runtime dependency context manager
        - as interactive interpreter in dependency context
        - as module launcher (akin to `python -m`)
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        The ``examples`` folder in this project includes some examples demonstrating
        the power and usefulness of the project. Read the docs on those examples
        for instructions.
        
        Interactive Interpreter
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        RWT also offers a painless way to run a Python interactive
        interpreter in the context of certain dependencies::
        
            $ /clean-install/python -m rwt boto
            Loading requirements using boto
            >>> import boto
            >>>
        
        Versioning
        ----------
        
        RWT uses semver, so you can use this library with
        confidence about the stability of the interface, even
        during periods of great flux.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Invoke tests with ``setup.py test``.

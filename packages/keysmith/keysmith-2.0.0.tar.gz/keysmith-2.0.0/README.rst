Keysmith
========

Keysmith randomly chooses words from a list and concatenates them. With
a sufficiently large list, these make `decent
passphrases <//xkcd.com/936>`__ that tend to be more memorable than
other random passwords. The concept is essentially the same as (and
arguably simpler than) `Diceware <//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware>`__.

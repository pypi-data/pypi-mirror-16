class MstConfiguration(object):
    """
    Class that defines the parameters used for microstate model computation and visualization.

    Attributes
    ----------
        subtract_column_mean_at_start (bool) : bool
			subtract column mean within microstate preprocessing
        debug : bool
			set to True for more detailed printing
        use_gfp_peaks : bool
			compute microstates based on global field power peaks only
        force_avgref : bool
			recompute average reference before microstate computation
        set_gfp_all_1 : bool
			set global field power to 1 before microstate computation
        use_smoothing : bool
			smoothe global field power curve before peak extraction (default = False)
        gfp_type_smoothing : {'hamming', 'hanning'}
            `hamming` : use hamming window to smooth global field power curve before peak identification
            `hanning` : use hanning window to smooth global field power curve before peak identification		
        smoothing_window : int
        		window for smoothing in time frames to reduce high frequency noise before peak identification (depends on time frames per second), e.g. 100.
        use_fancy_peaks : bool
            Whether a particular smoothing algorithm from scipy.signal.find_peaks_cwt is applied before peak computation or not.

        method_GFPpeak : {'GFPL1', 'GFPL2'}
            `GFPL1` : use L1-Norm to compute GFP peaks (default)
            `GFPL2` : use L2-Norm to compute GFP peaks
        original_nr_of_maps : int
            Number of maps to compute from microstate modelmaps algorithm (default = 4).
        seed_number : int
            Number of seeds used for modelmap algorithms (default = 200). It should be at least 3 times larger than the average number of GFP peaks you would like to compute the modelmaps based on.
        max_number_of_iterations : int
            The maximal number of iterations performed to increase the variance explained by the defined N modelmaps (not implemented). 
        ERP : bool
            Whether microstate computation is done based on ERP (time-locked) data (in this case map polarity is considered). (default = False, ERP not implemented)
        correspondance_cutoff : double
            Pearson correlation coefficient minimum or dissimilarity maximum that is regarded as the microstate of a particular class (used for microstate class visualization across time) (default = 0 which means no cutoff).
        fixed_seed : int
            Fixate seed for testing for modelmaps and mean models algorithms (default=100). Can be None!
        dissimilarity_measure : {'correlation', 'dissimilarity'}
            Determines the measure to assess similarity between two maps (default='dissimilarity').
        modelmaps_normalization_type : {'vector_norm_1','gfp1','none'}
            Specifies how modelmaps and mean models are normalized during microstate and modelmap computation (defualt='vector_norm_1').

development version
-------------------
* Optionally, sequences are not renamed in the ``assigned.tab`` file, but
  retain their original name as in the FASTA or FASTQ file. Set ``rename:
  false`` in the configuration file to get this behavior.
* Started an “advanced” section in the manual.

v0.2

* IgDiscover can now also detect kappa and lambda light chain V genes (VK, VL)

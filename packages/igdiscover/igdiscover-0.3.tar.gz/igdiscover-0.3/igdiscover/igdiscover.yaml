## IgDiscover configuration

library_name:

# Choose a species support by IgBLAST, such as 'human', 'mouse' or 'rhesus_monkey'
species: rhesus_monkey


# How many discovery iterations to run.
# If 0, the database will not be updated.
iterations: 4


# If you have a random barcode sequence (unique molecular identifier) at the 5' end,
# set this to its length. Leave at 0 when you have no 5' barcode.
barcode_length_5prime: 0

# Same as above, but for the 3' end of the sequence. Leave at 0 when you have no 3' barcode.
# Currently, you cannot have a barcode in both ends, so at least one of the two settings
# must be zero.
barcode_length_3prime: 0


## Primer-related settings

# If set to true, it is assumed that the forward primer is always at the 5' end
# of the first read and that the reverse primer is always at the 5' end of the
# second read. If it can also be the other way, set this to false.
# This setting has no effect if no primer sequences are defined below.
stranded: false

forward_primers:

# Work only on this number of reads (for quick test runs). Set to false to
# process all reads.

## Advanced settings (usually do not need to be changed)

# Filter out merged reads that are shorter than this length.
minimum_merged_read_length: 300


# When discovering new V genes, ignore whether a J gene has been assigned
# and also ignore its %SHM.
#
#ignore_j: false


# Read merging program. Choose either 'pear' or 'flash'.
# pear merges more reads, but is slower.
#
#merge_program: pear


# Which program to use for computing multiple alignments. This is used for
# computing consens sequences.
# Choose 'mafft', 'clustalo', 'muscle' or 'muscle-fast'.
# 'muscle-fast' runs muscle with parameters "-maxiters 1 -diags".
#
#multialign_program: muscle-fast


# Maximum overlap (-M) for the flash read merger.
# If you use pear, this is ignored.
#
#flash_maximum_overlap: 300


# When clustering sequences to discover new genes, subsample to this number of
# sequences. Higher is slower.
#
#subsample: 1000


# Which program to use for clustering. Use vsearch or usearch (can also be an
# absolute path).
#
#cluster_program: vsearch


# Filter out reads that have more than this number of expected errors.
# Set to null to disable.
#
#maximum_expected_errors: null
#maximum_expected_errors: 5


# Discovered sequences must be derived from a cluster of at least this many
# sequences. This is the 'germline filter' criterion, that is, it is used
# only in the final iteration, not in the intermediate ones.
#
#minimum_cluster_size: 100


# Do not mention the original FASTA or FASTQ sequence names in the
# assigned.tab files, but instead use names <library_name>_seq<number>,
# where <number> is a running number starting at 1.

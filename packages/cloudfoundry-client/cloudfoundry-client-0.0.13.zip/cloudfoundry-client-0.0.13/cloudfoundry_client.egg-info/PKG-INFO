        ================
        
        The cf-python-client repo contains a Python client library for Cloud Foundry. 
        
        ## Packaging
        
        To build the library run :
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Run the client
        
        To run the client, enter the following command :
        
        ```
        $ cloudfoundry-client
        ```

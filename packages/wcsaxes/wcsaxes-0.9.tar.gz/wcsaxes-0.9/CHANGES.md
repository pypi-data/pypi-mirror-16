- Fix testing for Matplotlib 1.5.x and switch to using remote baseline
  images. [#195]

0.6 (2015-07-20)
----------------

- Fix a bug that caused ticks and labels to be incorrect if a WCS object was
  used that was not recognized as celestial by WCSlib but had angular units for
  the axes, when setting the coord_type to longitude/latitude. [#171]

- Switch to using pytest-mpl for image testing. [#168]

- Show users how to invert axes easily. [#158]

0.4 (2015-06-07)
----------------

- Astropy frame instances to now be passed to ``get_transform`` and ``get_coords_overlay``. [#149]

- Fixed bug that caused plotting to crash if there were no ticks on an axis.

- Fix compatibility with different versions of Matplotlib. [#153]

- Fix bug when plotting overlays on images with 3+ WCS dimensions.

- Fixed bug that occurred when hovering over an interactive plot before the
  axes were drawn the first time. [#152]

- Fix bug that occurred in some cases where Matplotlib would try and plot a
  grid as soon as the axes were initialized.

- Fix bug with plotting RGB images. [#15]

- Improved error message when passing non-existent frame to
  ``get_overlay_coords``. [#154]

0.3 (2014-12-07)
----------------

- Fixed a bug that caused axis labels to be incorrectly placed when hiding tick
  labels using ``set_visible(False)``. [#111]

- Fixed a bug that caused tick labels to not always appear. [#110]

- Fixed a bug that caused the clip path for images to not be updated when
  making subsequent changes after drawing the figure. [#117]

- Fixed a bug that caused the clip path for images to not be updated after
  calling reset_wcs. [#120]

- Added ``CoordinateHelper.get_axislabel()`` method. [#122]

- Improve handling of get/set_xlabel/ylabel. [#94, #126]

- Added new feature to display world coordinates in interactive mode. [#112]

- When converting celestial coordinates, don't compute a new representation if
  the old one was already spherical or unit spherical. [#125]

- WCS instances from ``wcsaxes.wcs_wrapper`` can now be used to instantiate
  Matplotlib plots with the ``projection=`` keyword. [#136]

- Example datasets are now downloaded from http://data.astropy.org. [#144]

- Registering new frame identifiers is now done with the same API as in
  astropy.wcs.utils, and is handled in wcsaxes.wcs_utils. [#145]

0.2 (2014-08-11)

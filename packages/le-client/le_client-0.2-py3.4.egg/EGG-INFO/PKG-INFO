        le_client
        =========
        
        This is yet another ACME/Let's Encrypt client.
        It's inspired by acme-tiny, but does things differently.

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - The client is written in Python 3.
          It's incompatible with Python 2.x at the moment.
        
        - There are no dependencies on any third-party
          Python modules. The code should run fine on
          a bare Python setup, without anything from PyPI.
        
        - You need ``openssl`` command-line executable available
          for use in ``PATH``. It's used for keys and certificate
          request parsing.
        
        
        Features and limitations
        ------------------------
        
        - Does not know anything about servers or software.
          Its only purpose is to obtain a signed certificate.
        
        - Currently, the only supported challenge type is
          ``http-01`` (webroot).
        
        - Does not require any fancy privileges.
        
          It needs to access the certificate request, have write
          access to ``/.well-known/acme-challenge/`` and can output
          the obtained certificate to a file or on stdout.
        
        - It works with either local account key file,
          or can use a special remote service that can sign
          requests.
        
          That was the primary reason why I wrote my own client:
          I didn't want to keep an account's private key
          on the untrusted machine.
        
        - Currently, it only supports EC-256 account keys.
          It's easy to add other curve sizes and RSA support,
          but I'm lazy.
        
        - It's meant to be either usable as a standalone
          command-line utility, or as a simple Python library.
        
        
        Remote account key protocol
        ---------------------------
        
        This client supports a special mode of operation where
        it doesn't have a local account private key, but asks
        a remote service to sign whatever payload it needs.
        
        A remote service is located at a single URL, served
        over HTTPS. To authenticate the client, CLI currently
        supports only HTTP Basic Authentication.
        
        To sign, we send POST request to a given URL,
        appending ``nonce`` query parameter, and sending
        the payload as the POST body. We expect the server
        to answer with 200 OK an return a JWS as a response.
        
        That's the whole protocol description.

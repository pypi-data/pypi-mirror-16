Dyn53
=====

A tool for updating route53 addresses, simulating a dynamic DNS service by
asking `ipify.org <http://ipify.org>`_ and using boto3, it is meant to run
via crontab on python3 enabled devices. It uses, dnspython, certifi, requests,
and boto3.

Dyn53 is tested against python versions 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.

Install
-------

    ``pip3 install dyn53``

Alternatively, download the package, decompress and run:

 ``python setup.py install``


Usage
-----

Configure dyn53 by editing ~/.config/dyn53.conf, if the file is not present,
a sample one will be created. Boto3 config is not required, nor used.

.. code-block:: bash

    > dyn53
    2016-07-25 14:22:58,212 - dyn53 - INFO - Creating sample config file: /home/user/.config/dyn53.conf.sample
    No config file found, exiting.

    > cat ~/.config/dyn53.conf.sample
    [dyn53]
    hosted_zone_id = My hosted Zone Id
    domain = domain.tld.
    ttl = 300
    debug = False
    aws_sec_key = MY SECRET KEY
    aws_key = MY KEY

    > mv ~/.config/dyn53.conf.sample ~/.config/dyn53.conf
    > vi ~/.config/dyn53.conf

    > dyn53  -s myhost --debug
    2016-07-26 00:42:31,646 - dyn53 - DEBUG - Got ip: 52.37.72.89
    2016-07-26 00:42:31,707 - dyn53 - DEBUG - FQDN is already pointing at 52.37.72.89

Notes
-----

* If no address is passed as argument ([-a address]), ipify.org service will
  be checked via https to resolve the current public IP address.
* dyn53 is lazy, if the domain is already pointing to the resolved or given
  address, it wont update the record.

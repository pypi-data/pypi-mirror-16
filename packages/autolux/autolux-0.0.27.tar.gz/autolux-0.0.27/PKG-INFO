Description: =======
        autolux
        =======
        
        inspired by `lumen <https://github.com/anishathalye/lumen>` but written for
        \*nix machines. autolux takes a screenshot every few seconds, figures out the
        'average value' of the resulting image (the **luminence**) and changes the
        screen brightness based on your screen's contents.
        
        installation
        ------------
        
          pip install autolux
        
        dependencies
        ------------
        
        * python2 (not python3)
        * imagemagick (for screenshots + determining average brightness)
        * xdotool (finding focused window)
        * xbacklight (for setting display brightness)

            # have a higher predicted brightness. the blue regions are high luminence
            # content with a lower predicted brightness

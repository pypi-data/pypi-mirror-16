        autolux
        =======
        
        inspired by [lumen](https://github.com/anishathalye/lumen) but written for
        \*nix machines. autolux takes a screenshot every few seconds, figures out the
        'average value' of the resulting image and changes the screen brightness based
        on screen's contents.

        how it works
        ---
        
        autolux is a simple python script that takes a screenshot of a vertical strip
        every few seconds and calculates the average pixel value. in order to save CPU,
        a screenshot is only taken if the window has changed since the last time a
        screenshot was taken

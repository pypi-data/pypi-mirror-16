Description: =======
        autolux
        =======
        
        inspired by `lumen <https://github.com/anishathalye/lumen>` but written for
        \*nix machines. autolux takes a screenshot every few seconds, figures out the
        'average value' of the resulting image and changes the screen brightness based
        on screen's contents.
        
        installation
        ------------
        
          pip install autolux

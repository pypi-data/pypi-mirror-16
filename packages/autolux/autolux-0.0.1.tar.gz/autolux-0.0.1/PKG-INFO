Description: # autolux
        
        inspired by [lumen](https://github.com/anishathalye/lumen) but written for
        \*nix machines. autolux takes a screenshot every few seconds, figures out the
        'average value' of the resulting image and changes the screen brightness based
        on screen's contents.
        
        ## dependencies
        
        * imagemagick (for screenshots + determining average brightness)
        * xdotool (finding focused window)
        * xbacklight (for setting display brightness)
        
        ## usage:
        
            autolux --help
        
            # check screen every 5 seconds, takes 500ms to fade brightness to next state
            autolux --interval 5000 --fade-time 500

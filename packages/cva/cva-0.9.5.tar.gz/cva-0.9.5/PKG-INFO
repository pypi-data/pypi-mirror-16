Description: cva -- Calculus of Variations
        =============================
        
        The cva library (pronounced see-va) implements a solver for problems 
        in the domain of the calculus of variations.  This includes such
        problems as finding geodesics on arbitrary surfaces, finding minimal
        paths in curved spacetime, or basically any path minimization problem 
        that can be defined in terms of a surface or hypersurface model with an 
        attached metric.

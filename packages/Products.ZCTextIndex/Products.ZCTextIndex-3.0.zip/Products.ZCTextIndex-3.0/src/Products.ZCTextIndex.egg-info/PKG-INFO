Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This distribution contains a full text indexing facility for Zope 2 and more
        specifically for Products.ZCatalog.
        
        This product is a replacement for the full text indexing facility of
        Products.ZCatalog.
        
        Advantages of using ZCTextIndex:
        
        - A new query language, supporting both explicit and implicit Boolean
          operators, parentheses, globbing, and phrase searching.  Apart from
          explicit operators and globbing, the syntax is roughly the same as
          that popularized by Google.
        
        - A more refined scoring algorithm, resulting in better selectiveness:
          it's much more likely that you'll find the document you are looking
          for among the first few highest-ranked results.
        
        - Actually, ZCTextIndex gives you a choice of two scoring algorithms
          from recent literature: the Cosine ranking from the Managing
          Gigabytes book, and Okapi from more recent research papers.  Okapi
          usually does better, so it is the default (but your milage may
          vary).
        
        - A redesigned Lexicon, using a pipeline architecture to split the
          input text into words.  This makes it possible to mix and match
          pipeline components, e.g. you can choose between an HTML-aware
          splitter and a plain text splitter, and additional components can be
          added to the pipeline for case folding, stopword removal, and other
          features.  Enough example pipeline components are provided to get
          you started, and it is very easy to write new components.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        3.0 (2016-07-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Replace stopper and okascore C implementations with pure-Python.
        
        - Remove HelpSys pages.
        
        - Remove various internal test helper modules.
        
        - Remove old-style interface modules, use the interfaces module instead.
        
        - Update to ZODB 4.x as direct dependency. Which drops ZODB3 support.
        
        2.13.5 (2014-02-19)
        -------------------
        
        - Add `getIndexQueryNames` method to index to comply with extended interface.
        
        2.13.4 (2012-12-03)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed problem where the index was not reindexed if the new value was an empty
          string leading to inconsistence between the object attribute (that is empty)
          and the index that still contains the old indexed value.
        
        2.13.3 (2011-07-28)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed problem in reindex document optimization, which could lead to negative
          document counts when reindexing unchanged documents.
        
        2.13.2 (2011-05-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Avoid changing data, if the indexed values stayed the same.
        
        2.13.1 (2010-10-02)
        -------------------
        
        - Changed word id creation algorithm in Lexicon. Instead of relying on an
          increasing length counter, we use a number from a randomized range. This
          avoids conflict errors while adding new words in multiple parallel
          transactions. Inspired by code from ``enfold.fixes``.
        
        - Lexicon: Added clear method.
        
        - Lexicon: Removed BBB code for instances created with Zope < 2.6.2.
        
        - Added missing namespace_packages declaration to setup.py.
        
        2.13.0 (2010-06-19)
        -------------------
        
        - Released as separate package.

|skidl| was inspired by two other projects:

* `PHDL <https://sourceforge.net/p/phdl/wiki/Home/>`_ is a schematic design 
  language that exemplifies the main feature I wanted in |skidl| : 
  concise, text-based design entry with support for hierarchy.
* `MyHDL <http://myhdl.org/>`_ showed how to use the features of Python to support a particular
  application (designing/simulating digital logic systems) while keeping access to a
  rich software ecosystem.

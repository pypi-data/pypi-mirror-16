Description: Secrets Vault
        =============
        
        |Build Status| |PyPI|
        
        A
        `humilis <https://github.com/InnovativeTravel/humilis/blob/master/README.md>`__
        plugin that implements a ``secrets-vault`` layer. The layer consists of
        an encrypted DynamoDB table that serves secrets to Lambda functions in
        the same humilis environment. The encryption and decryption of secrets
        is handled by AWS `KMS service <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/humilis-secrets-vault>`__:
        
        ::
        
            pip install humilis-secrets-vault
        
        To install the dev version:
        
        ::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/InnovativeTravel/humilis-secrets-vault
        
        How do I use this?
        ------------------
        
        Simply add this layer to your
        `humilis <https://github.com/InnovativeTravel/humilis/blob/master/README.md>`__
        environment and use the layer parameter ``associated_processors`` to
        specify the layers that contain the Lambda functions that require access
        to the secrets in the vault. For example, the environment below deploys
        a Lambda function that processes events in a Kinesis stream. The Lambda
        processor is granted access to the secrets vault that is also part of
        the same environment:
        
        ::
        
            ---
            myenvironment:
                description:
                    An environment with a Lambda processor to filter events in a Kinesis
                    stream.
        
                layers:
                    - layer: streams
                      layer_type: streams
                      streams:
                          - name: InputStream
                            shard_count: 1
        
                    - layer: event-processor
                      layer_type: kinesis-processor
                      dependencies: ["streams"]
                      input: {layer: streams, stream: InputStream}
        
                    - layer: secrets-vault
                      layer_type: secrets-vault
                      # We specify that the Lambda function in the event-processor layer
                      # should have access to the secrets in the vault.
                      associated_processors: ["event-processor"]
        
        The ``secrets-vault`` layer expects that the layer(s) that contain the
        Lambda processor(s) expose a layer output ``LambdaFunctionArn`` with the
        ARN of the Lambda function that should have access to the secrets in the
        vault. Layers of type
        `kinesis-processor <https://github.com/humilis/humilis-kinesis-processor>`__
        as in the example above fulfil this expectation so they will work
        out-of-the-box.
        
        Retrieving secrets
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The easiest way of retrieving secrets from your Lambda function is to
        include package
        `lambdautils <https://github.com/humilis/humilis-lambdautils>`__ as a
        depencency.
        
        Then you can easily retrieve secrets from the vault within your Lambda
        code as follows:
        
        ::
        
            import lambdautils.utils as utils
        
            # Assuming that you are deploying this Lambda with humilis the line below
            # will indicate humilis to preprocess this function with Jinja2 before
            # producing the Lambda deployment package.
            # preprocessor:jinja2
        
            # During deployment, humilis will replace here the name of the humilis
            # environment and deployment stage.
            ENVIRONMENT = "{{_env.name}}"
            STAGE = "{{_env.stage}}"
        
            plaintext = utils.get_secret(
                "my_secret_key", environment=ENVIRONMENT, stage=STAGE)
        
        Storing secrets
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can use
        `humilis <https://github.com/InnovativeTravel/humilis/blob/master/README.md>`__
        to store secrets in the vault from the command line:
        
        ::
        
            humilis set-secret --stage [STAGE] [ENVIRONMENT_FILE] [SECRET_KEY] [SECRET_VALUE]
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Assuming you have
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
        installed:
        
        ::
        
            make develop
        
        Configure humilis:
        
        ::
        
            .env/bin/humilis configure --local
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        You can test the deployment of the secrets vault using:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make create
        
        Then you can then run the integration test suite (TBD):
        
        ::
        
            make testi
        
        Don't forget to delete the test deployment once you are done:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            make delete

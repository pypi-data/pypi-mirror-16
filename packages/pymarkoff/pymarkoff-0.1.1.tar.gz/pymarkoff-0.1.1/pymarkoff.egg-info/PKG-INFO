Description: Originally a proof of concept, I've used this in enough projects that I've decided to publish it tomake it easier to import.
        #Basic Use
        
        Instantiate with `m = markoff.Markov(seeds)` where `seeds` is an iterable of sub-iterables. Each sub-iterable being a chain in the set of chains you want to model.
        
        You can supply it with just one chain or many.
        
        Then use `m.generate(max_length=100)` to produce a single chain limited to `max_length` automatically terminating at any character of `.!?`.
        You can also supply a `terminators` argument to make the chain

Tunnels
=======

Tunnels are the lowest-level API, used for invoking commands on an individual
host or container. For a higher-level API that allows invoking commands in
parallel across a range of hosts, see :doc:`groups`.

An established tunnel can be used to invoke commands and receive results.

Writing new tunnels
-------------------

It is possible to write a new tunnel driver for any system that allows you to
execute a ``python`` binary with direct relay of ``stdin`` and ``stdout``
pipes. To do this, simply subclass ``chopsticks.group.SubprocessTunnel``. Note
that all tunnel instances must have a ``host`` attibute which is used as the
key for the result in the :class:`GroupResult` dictionary when executing tasks
in a :class:`Group`.

So, strictly, these requirements apply:

* The tunnel setup machinery should not write to ``stdout`` - else you will
  have to identify and consume this output.
* The tunnel setup machinery should not read from ``stdin`` - else you will
  have to feed the required input.
* Both ``stdin`` and ``stdout`` must be binary-safe pipes.

The tunnel machinery may write to ``stderr``; this output will be presented to
the user.

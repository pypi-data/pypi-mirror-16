``assoc_xmatch_columns``	['3FGL_Name']	Choose a set of association columns on which to cross-match catalogs.
``catalogs``	None	
``diffuse``	None	
``extdir``	None	Set a directory that will be searched for extended source FITS templates.  Template files in this directory will take precendence over catalog source templates with the same name.
``extract_diffuse``	False	Extract a copy of all mapcube components centered on the ROI.
``galdiff``	None	Set the galactic IEM mapcube.
``isodiff``	None	Set the isotropic template.
``limbdiff``	None	
``merge_sources``	True	Merge properties of sources that appear in multiple source catalogs.  If merge_sources=false then subsequent sources with the same name will be ignored.
``sources``	None	
``src_radius``	None	Radius of circular selection cut for inclusion of catalog sources in the model.  Includes sources within a circle of this radius centered on the ROI.  If this parameter is none then no selection is applied.  This selection will be ORed with the ``src_roiwidth`` selection.
``src_radius_roi``	None	Half-width of ``src_roiwidth`` selection.  This parameter can be used in lieu of ``src_roiwidth``.
``src_roiwidth``	None	Width of square selection cut for inclusion of catalog sources in the model.  Includes sources within a square region with side ``src_roiwidth`` centered on the ROI.  If this parameter is none then no selection is applied.  This selection will be ORed with the ``src_radius`` selection.

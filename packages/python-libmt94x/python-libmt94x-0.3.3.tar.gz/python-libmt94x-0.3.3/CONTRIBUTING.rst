Contributing to libmt94x
========================

If you are interested in contributing to libmt94x please read this first. :)

* If you wish to report a bug please create an Issue for it. Make sure you
  include enough detail (software versions, platform etc) to allow us to
  reproduce it.

* If you wish to make a change (add a feature, refactor something) create an
  Issue first and describe your idea. This gives the maintainers a chance to
  review your idea before you put lots of effort into something that may or may
  not fit with the direction of the project.

* If you are submitting a Pull Request please make sure that you add tests for
  the code you are adding. Also make sure that all the existing tests are still
  passing (the entire ``tox`` execution should succeed, including the style
  checks).

Note that libmt94x uses the git-flow development workflow, so our integration
branch is develop and new features are developed in feature branches and merged
into develop using pull requests.

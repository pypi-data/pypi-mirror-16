Django Dynamic Fixtures
=======================

Django Dynamic Fixtures is a Django app which gives you the ability to setup
fixture-data in a more dynamic way. Static fixtures are sometimes too
static in a way that for example even the primary keys are static defined, this
can be very hard to maintain especially in bigger projects. Another example;
when your application depends on data with a recent timestamp your static
fixtures can get 'outdated'.

For all these issues Django Dynamic Fixtures has a solution and even more!

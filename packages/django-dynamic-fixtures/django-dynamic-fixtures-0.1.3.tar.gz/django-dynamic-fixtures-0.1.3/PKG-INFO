        Django Dynamic Fixtures
        =======================
        
        Django Dynamic Fixtures is a Django app which gives you the ability to setup
        fixture-data in a more dynamic way. Static fixtures are sometimes too
        static in a way that for example even the primary keys are static defined, this
        can be very hard to maintain especially in bigger projects. Another example;
        when your application depends on data with a recent timestamp your static
        fixtures can get 'outdated'.
        
        For all these issues Django Dynamic Fixtures has a solution and even more!

Stable release
--------------

To install PyHo, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyho

This is the preferred method to install PyHo, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

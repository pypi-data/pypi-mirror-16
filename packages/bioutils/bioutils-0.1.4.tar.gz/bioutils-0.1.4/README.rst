bioutils -- simple bioinformatics utilities and lookup tables
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

bioutils provides some common tools and lookup tables used primarly by
the `hgvs <https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/>`_ and `uta
<https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/uta/>`_ packages.  This package is
not really intended for broader use (read: it may change without
notice).

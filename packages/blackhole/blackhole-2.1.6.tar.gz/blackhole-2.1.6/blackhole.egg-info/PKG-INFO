        Blackhole is an `MTA (message transfer agent)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent>`_ that (figuratively)
        pipes all mail to /dev/null.
        
        Blackhole is built on top of `asyncio
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ and utilises `async def <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def>`_
        and `await <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#await>`_
        statements available in `Python 3.5
        <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html>`_ and above.
        
        While blackhole is an MTA (mail transport agent), none of the actions
        performed via SMTP or SMTPS are actually processed and no email or sent or
        delivered.
        
        You can tell blackhole how to handle mail that it receives. It can accept all
        of it, bounce it all or randomly do either of those two actions. No matter how
        you choose to configure it, the email is never actually delivered, it just
        appears to have been delivered or bounced.
        
        Think of blackhole sort of like a honeypot in terms of how it handles mail,
        but it's specifically designed with testing in mind.
        
        Service status
        ==============
        
        You can find the current service status on `status.blackhole.io
        <http://status.blackhole.io/>`_.
        
        Donations
        =========
        
        Blackhole costs a bit of money to run, it receives millions of emails on a
        daily basis, sometimes millions every 5 minutes depending on the load of the
        platform.
        
        To keep Blackhole running, please think about donating even just a little to
        the project `via Gratipay <https://gratipay.com/blackhole.io/>`_.
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        Blackhole was first built when I was working on a project that required me to
        be able to send/receive millions of emails per minute. As the sender was being
        prototyped, I quickly realised that any mail server I pointed it at would fall
        over due to the stess -- thus blackhole was born.

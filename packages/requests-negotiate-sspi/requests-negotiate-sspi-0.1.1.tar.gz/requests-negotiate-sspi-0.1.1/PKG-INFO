Description: requests-negotiate-sspi
        =======================
        
        An implementation of HTTP Negotiate authentication for Requests.
        This module provides single-sign-on using Kerberos or NTLM using the
        Windows SSPI interface.
        
        This module supports Extended Protection for Authentication (aka 
        Channel Binding Hash), which makes it usable for services that require
        it, including Active Directory Federation Services.
        
        The module does not (at this time) support password-based authentication.

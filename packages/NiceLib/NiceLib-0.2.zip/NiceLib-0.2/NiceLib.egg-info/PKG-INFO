        ==============
        
        NiceLib is a Python library for rapidly developing "nice" basic wrappers for calling C libraries,
        using ``cffi``. Essentially, it lets you take a C shared library (.dll or .so) and its headers and
        rapidly create a nice pythonic interface.
        
        NiceLib accomplishes this in two main ways: first, it converts header files (macros and all) into a
        format usable by ``cffi`` (i.e. it preprocesses them); second, it provides an API for quickly and
        cleanly defining pythonic mid-level interfaces that wrap low-level libraries.
        
        For install information, documentation, examples, and more, see our page on

Description: wundertool-py
        ==============
        Tool for working with `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ containers.
        
        Mission statement:
        
        1. Provide a simplified and unified tool for all the members of the team.
        2. Provide additional functionality to existing tools.
        3. Include everything from developing to packaging and deploying code in one tool.
        3. Allow the project team to easily define the whole stack of software required for the project that is used everywhere from local development to production.
        
        Requirements:
        
        - docker
        - python 3 or later
        
        Installation
        ------------
        You can always install the tool from PyPI with::
        
          pip install wundertool
        
        *Note: OS X doesn't have python 3 or pip installed by default. You should install them with `brew` first and then install `wundertool`*::
        
          brew install python3
          pip3 install wundertool
        
        Upgrade
        -------
        Upgrade to the latest version with::
        
          pip install wundertool --upgrade
        
        or on OS X with python 3::
        
          pip3 install wundertool --upgrade
        
        Usage
        -----
        Currently available commands are mostly equivalent of those of docker-compose. See this for list of available commands::

        Development
        -----------
        Requirements:
        
        - python 3.4 or later
        
        You can clone this module locally and install it in development mode in an virtual environment like this::
        
          git clone https://github.com/wunderkraut/wundertool-py.git
          cd wundertool-py
          git submodule init
          git submodule update
          pyvenv .
          source bin/activate
          pip install -e ".[dev]"
        
        You always need to activate the wundertool-py virtual environment when opening a new terminal for development::
        
          source <DIR>/wundertool-py/bin/activate
        
        Submodule upstream changes can be updated with::
        
          git submodule update --remote
        
        Distribution packages to PyPI can be created with::
        
          python setup.py sdist
          python setup.py bdist_wheel
        
        Distribution packages can be uploaded to PyPI with::
        
          twine upload dist/wundertool-[version].tar.gz
          twine upload dist/wundertool-[version]-py3-none-any.whl

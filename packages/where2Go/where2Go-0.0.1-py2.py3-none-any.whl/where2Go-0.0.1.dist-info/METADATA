# where2Go

where2Go is meant to be your weekend-travel assistant. It is an application, written in Python3.5.

Let's say you live in Sofia and want to go out of town for a day, somewhere in the nature. where2Go will store data about natural landmarks in Bulgaria, devided into the following groups: waterfalls, peaks, lakes and mountain trails. The user will choose a category and the program will take information from the internet about the weather in each one of the landmarks in the chosen group and will tell the user the best option for him - the closest one with the best weather on the day he wants go. After that will be given information about how to reach that place and with directions from his current position. This will be accomplished with the Google Maps API.

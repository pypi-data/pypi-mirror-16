      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        =======================
        
        .. _travis : https://travis-ci.org/alexprengere/FormalSystems
        .. |travis| image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/alexprengere/FormalSystems.png
        
        This is a Python implementation of *Douglas Hofstadter* formal systems, from his book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* (commonly *GEB*).
        
        In fact, you may define your *own formal systems* using a quite simple syntax, close to free text.
        Examples for *MIU*, *pg*, *fg* and *NDP* formal systems from the book are implemented in directory *definitions*.
        
        A main Python script gives you possibilities to play with the formal system, including:
        
        - axiom schema support (iteration, decision procedure)
        - theorem step by step generation (using different algorithms)
        - theorem derivation
        
        
        ------------------------
        Formal system definition
        ------------------------
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        The *MIU* system may be define with:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            axioms:
                - MI
        
            rules:
                - x is .*, xI => xIU
                - x is .*, Mx => Mxx
                - x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy
                - x y  .* , xUUy => xy
        
        The underlying syntax is YAML (see raw format). You can define one or several axioms, or even an infinite number of axioms using a schema, as in the *pg* formal system:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
            axioms:
                - x is -+, xp-gx-
        
            rules:
                - x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-
        
        
        Syntax
        ======
        
        Axiom definitions should be formatted like this (``[]`` means this is optional):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         [def_1, [def_2, ...]] expr
        
        Where:
        
        - ``def_i`` is an optional definition of *wildcard*, using a regular expression, for example:
        
          - ".*" may be anything including the empty string
          - "-+" is a string composed of "-"
        
        The definitions are written using ``char [is] regexp`` or ``char1 char2 [are] regexp`` if different wildcards have the same definition. Note that you should use only *one character* for wildcard definition.
        
        - ``expr`` is the axiom expression
        
        Rules for theorem production should be formatted like this:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         [def_1, [def_2, ...]] cond_1 [and cond_2 [and ...]] => th_1 [and th_2 [and ...]]
        
        Where:
        
        - ``def_i`` is the same as before
        - ``cond_i`` is a required theorem, in order to produce new theorems (separated by *and* if several conditions)
        - ``th_i`` is a produced theorems with the rule
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ python setup.py install --user
        
        A script should be put in ``~/.local/bin``, make sure this path is in your ``$PATH``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
        
        -----
        Tests
        -----
        
        If installation is successful, run the tests with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ cd tests
         $ python test_formalsystems.py -v
        
        -----------
        Main script
        -----------
        
        After installation, you should have the main script ``FormalSystemsMain.py`` deployed somewhere where you ``$PATH`` points to, under the name ``FormalSystems``.
        If it is not the case, you can always execute the script directly, assuming the dependencies are properly installed (just *pyyaml* and *LEPL*).
        
        Usage of the main script is fully documented in ``--help`` argument.
        
        You may generate theorems step by step if the number of axioms is finite:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ FormalSystems definitions/MIU.yaml --iteration 3 
         > Finite number of axioms, using step algorithm
        
         STEP 1: MI
        
         P  (1) x is .*, xI => xIU                    for  MI                         gives  MIU
         P  (2) x is .*, Mx => Mxx                    for  MI                         gives  MII
         .  (3) x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy        for  MI                       
         .  (4) x y  .* , xUUy => xy                  for  MI                       
        
         STEP 2: MIU/MII
        
         P  (1) x is .*, xI => xIU                    for  MII                        gives  MIIU
         .  (1) x is .*, xI => xIU                    for  MIU                      
         P  (2) x is .*, Mx => Mxx                    for  MII                        gives  MIIII
         P  (2) x is .*, Mx => Mxx                    for  MIU                        gives  MIUIU
         .  (3) x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy        for  MII                      
         .  (3) x is .*, y is .*, xIIIy => xUy        for  MIU                      
         .  (4) x y  .* , xUUy => xy                  for  MII                      
         .  (4) x y  .* , xUUy => xy                  for  MIU                      
        
         STEP 3: MIIU/MIIII/MIUIU
        
        Or using a bucket where axioms are thrown and theorems computed iteratively if the number of axioms is infinite:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ FormalSystems definitions/pg.yaml --iteration 4
         > Infinite number of axioms, using bucket algorithm
        
         [Adding -p-g-- to bucket]
        
         === BUCKET 1: -p-g--
        
         P  (1) x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-        for  -p-g--                     gives  -p--g---
         [Adding --p-g--- to bucket]
        
         === BUCKET 2: -p--g---/--p-g---
        
         P  (1) x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-        for  -p--g---                   gives  -p---g----
         P  (1) x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-        for  --p-g---                   gives  --p--g----
         [Adding ---p-g---- to bucket]
        
         === BUCKET 3: -p---g----/--p--g----/---p-g----
        
         P  (1) x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-        for  -p---g----                 gives  -p----g-----
         P  (1) x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-        for  ---p-g----                 gives  ---p--g-----
         P  (1) x y z are -+, xpygz => xpy-gz-        for  --p--g----                 gives  --p---g-----

         === BUCKET 4: -p----g-----/---p--g-----/--p---g-----/----p-g-----
        
        Options are available to display theorem derivation as well:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
         $ FormalSystems definitions/NDP.yaml --quiet --derivation P-----
         > Infinite number of axioms, using bucket algorithm

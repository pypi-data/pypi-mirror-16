Description: Nix(OS) vulnerability scanner
        =============================
        
        This is a utility that validates a Nix store for any packages that are
        reachable from live paths and likely to be affected by vulnerabilities
        listed in the NVD.
        
        It implements a CLI utility to inspect the current status and a
        monitoring integration for Sensu.
        
        Example output::
        
            Security issues for sqlite, libxml2, ... (and 10 more)
        
            sqlite-2.9.3 (inprogress)
                https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2073
                https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8710
        
                See https://plan.flyingcircus.io/issues/18544
        
        
            libxml2-2.9.3
                https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3717
        
        Usage::
        
            $ nix-build
            $ ./result/bin/vulnix
        
        
        Whitelist
        =========
        
        The whitelist file uses a sub-set of the
        `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__ language to define rules
        which matches shall be ignored or in other words are declared to be
        trusted or in progress, hence the term whitelist. If the match is
        **partial**, e.G. there is a package which is affected by more than one
        vulnerability, but only one is whitelist, the match will still be
        printed except for the declared exception.
        
        Syntax
        ------
        
        Every rule starts with the ``-`` and a new-line, declaring a list
        element.

        Example
        -------
        
        There is an `example <src/vulnix/default_whitelist.yaml>`__ for a
        working whitelist file as part of the unit tests.

Description:         Robograph is a platform that allows you to define your algorithms as computational graphs.
                Once you've defined the graph, you can execute that graph as if it was a SW
                program and get the expected outputs.
                As each algorithm is composed by steps, each graph is composed by nodes, each
                one being a step of the bigger calculation. Each graph can accept any number of
                inputs and give at maximum one output.
                You can create your own graphs either by connecting any of the predefined
                basic nodes shipped with Robograph or by coding your custom nodes

Donate to the project
=====================

PayPal donations are used to cover the costs for project hosting, general
maintenance and support.  Basically, they are what keeps the free lxml
software alive for everyone to use.

If, instead, you are interested in financing the development of specific
features or the resolution of a specific problem, get in touch with the
lead developer, `Stefan Behnel <http://consulting.behnel.de/>`_.

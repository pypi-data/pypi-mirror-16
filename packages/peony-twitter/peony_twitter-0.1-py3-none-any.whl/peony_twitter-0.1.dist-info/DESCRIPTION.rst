<h2 id='install'>Installation</h2>

To install this module simply run:  

    pip install peony-twitter

<h1 id='getstarted'>Getting started</h1>

You can easily create a client using the class `PeonyClient`.
Make sure to get your api keys and access tokens from
[Twitter's application management page][apps]

*Note: the package name is peony and not peony-twitter*


```python
import asyncio

# Note: the package name is peony and not peony-twitter
from peony import PeonyClient

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

# create the client using your api keys
client = PeonyClient(consumer_key=YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY,
                     consumer_secret=YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET,
                     access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
                     access_token_secret=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

# this is a coroutine
req = client.api.statuses.update.post(status="I'm using Peony!!")

# run the coroutine
loop.run_until_complete(req)
```


[apps]: <https://apps.twitter.com>


<h1 id='usage'>Usage</h1>

You can easily access any Twitter API endpoint

```python
creds = dict(consumer_key=YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY,
             consumer_secret=YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET,
             access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
             access_token_secret=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)

client = PeonyClient(**creds)

# to access api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/home_timeline.json
# using the GET method with the parameters count and since_id
async def home():
    return await client.api.statuses.home_timeline.get(count=200, since_id=0)

# to access userstream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/filter.json
# using the POST method with the parameter track
async def track():
    async with client.stream.statuses.filter.post(track="uwu") as ressource:
        pass  # do something, see next chapter

# would GET subdomain.twitter.com/1.1/path.json if it were
# an API endpoint
async def path():
    return await client.subdomain.path.get()
```

that do not use the version '1.1'

<h2 id='response_access'>How to access the response data</h2>

<h3 id='rest_access'>From a REST API</h3>

A call to a REST API endpoint should return a PeonyResponse object.


```python
async def home():
    req = client.api.statuses.home_timeline.get(count=200, since_id=0)

    # this is a PeonyResponse object
    response = await req

    # you can iterate over the response object
    for tweet in response:
        # you can access items as you would do in a dictionnary
        user_id = tweet['user']['id']

        # or as you would access an attribute
        username = tweet.user.screen_name

        print("@{username} ({id}): {text}".format(username=username,
                                                  id=user_id,
                                                  text=tweet.text))
```


<h3 id='stream_access'>From a Streaming API</h3>

A call to a Streaming API endpoint should return a StreamContext object, that
yields a StreamResponse object.

```python
async def track():
    ctx = client.stream.statuses.filter.post(track="uwu")

    # this is an asynchronous context (StreamContext)
    async with ctx as stream:
        # stream is an asynchronous iterator (StreamResponse)
        async for tweet in stream:
            # you can then access items as you would do with a
            # PeonyResponse object
            user_id = tweet['user']['id']
            username = tweet.user.screen_name

            print("@{username} ({id}): {text}".format(username=username,
                                                      id=user_id,
                                                      text=tweet.text))
```

<h2 id='iterators'>Iterators</h2>

Sometimes you need to make several requests to the same API endpoint in order
to get all the data you want (e.g. getting more than 200 tweets of an user).  
Some iterators are included in Peony and usable through the peony.iterators
module that deals with the actual iteration, getting all the responses you need.

<h3 id='cursor_iterator'>Cursor iterator</h3>

This is an iterator for endpoints using the `cursor` parameter
(e.g. followers/ids.json). The first argument given to the iterator is the
coroutine function that will make the request.


```python
import peony.iterators
from peony import PeonyClient

# creds being a dictionnary containing your api keys
client = PeonyClient(**creds)

async def get_followers(user_id, **additional_params):
    followers_ids = peony.iterators.with_cursor(
        client.api.followers.ids.get,
        id=user_id,
        count=5000,
        **additional_params
    )

    followers = []
    async for data in followers_ids:
        followers.extend(data.ids)

    return followers
```

<h3 id="max_id_iterator">Max_id iterator</h3>
An iterator for endpoints using the `max_id` parameter
(e.g. statuses/user_timeline.json)


```python
from peony import PeonyClient
import peony.iterators

client = PeonyClient(**creds)

async def get_tweets(user_id, n_tweets=1600, **additional_params):
      responses = peony.iterators.with_max_id(
          client.api.statuses.user_timeline.get,
          user_id=user,
          count=200,
          **additional_params
      )

      user_tweets = []

      async for tweets in responses:
          user_tweets.extend(tweets)

          if len(user_tweets) >= n_tweets:
              user_tweets = user_tweets[:n_tweets]
              break

      return user_tweets
```

<h3 id='since_id_iterator'>Since_id iterator</h3>
An iterator for endpoints using the `since_id` parameter
(e.g. statuses/home_timeline.json)


```python
import asyncio
import html

try:
    from . import peony, api, testdir
except SystemError:
    from __init__ import peony, testdir
    import api


client = peony.PeonyClient(**api.keys)

async def get_home(since_id=None, **params):
    responses = peony.iterators.with_since_id(
        client.api.statuses.home_timeline.get,
        count=200,
        **params
    )

    home = []
    async for tweets in responses:
        for tweet in reversed(tweets):
            text = html.unescape(tweet.text)
            print("@{user.screen_name}: {text}".format(user=tweet.user,
                                                       text=text))
            print("-"*10)

        await asyncio.sleep(180)

    return sorted(home, key=lambda tweet: tweet.id)
```

<h2 id='tasks'>Tasks</h2>

The main advantage of an asynchronous client is that it will be able to run
multiple tasks... asynchronously.  
Which is quite interesting here if you want to access several Streaming APIs,
or perform some requests periodically while using a Streaming API.


So I tried to make it easier to create such a program.

<h2 id='task'>The `task` decorator</h2>

First you will need to create a subclass of PeonyClient and add a `task`
decorator to the methods that you want to run.


```python
import asyncio
import time

from peony import PeonyClient, task

class AwesomePeonyClient(PeonyClient):
    @staticmethod
    async def wait_awesome_hour():
        """ wait until the next awesome hour """
        await asyncio.sleep(-time.time() % 3600)

    async def send_awesome_tweet(self, status="Peony is awesome!!"):
        """ send an awesome tweet """
        await self.api.statuses.update.post(status=status)

    @task
    async def awesome_loop(self):
        """ send an awesome tweet every hour """
        while True:
            await self.wait_awesome_hour()
            await self.send_awesome_tweet()

    @task
    async def awesome_user(self):
        """ The user using this program must be just as awesome, right? """
        user = await self.api.account.verify_credentials.get()

        print("This is an awesome user", user.screen_name)

    @task
    async def awesome_stream(self):
        """
            Tweets that contain awesome without a typo must be
            quite awesome too
        """
        async with self.stream.statuses.filter(track="awesome") as stream:
            async for tweet in stream:
                print("This is an awesome tweet", tweet.text)


def main():
    """ run all the tasks simultaneously """
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    # set your api keys here
    awesome_client = AwesomePeonyClient(
        consumer_key=your_consumer_key,
        consumer_secret=your_consumer_secret,
        access_token=your_access_token,
        access_token_secret=your_access_token_secret
    )

    asyncio.ensure_future(asyncio.wait(awesome_client.tasks))
    loop.run_forever()

    # if there was no stream:
    # loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(awesome_client.tasks))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

<h2 id="event_handlers">Event handlers</h2>

Let's say that your awesome bot has become very popular, and so you'd like to
add some new features to it that would make use of the Streaming API. You could
use the `task` decorator but there is a better way to do it.  

*keeping the code from above*
```python

from peony import EventStream, event_handler, events

# adding permissions dirtily, you should probably try to load them in
# AwesomePeonyClient.__init__ instead
AwesomePeonyClient.permissions = {
    "admin": [42]
}

@AwesomePeonyClient.event_stream
class AwesomeUserStream(EventStream):

    @property
    def stream_request(self):
        # stream_request must return the request used to access the stream
        return self.userstream.user.get()

    @event_handler(*events.on_connect)
    def awesome_connection(self, data):
        print("Connected to stream!")

    @event_handler(*events.on_follow)
    def awesome_follow(self, data, *args):
        print("You have a new awesome follower @%s" % data.source.screen_name)

    # when adding a prefix argument to an event handler it adds a
    # command attribute to the function that you can use as a decorator
    # to create commands
    # it also adds a command argument to the event_handler
    @event_handler(*events.on_dm, prefix='/')
    async def awesome_dm_received(self, data, command):
        # Important: command.run is a coroutine
        msg = await command.run(self, data=data.direct_message)

        if msg:
            await self.api.direct_messages.new.post(
                user_id=data.direct_message.sender.id,
                text=msg
            )

    # Here a command is called when the dm contains:
    # "{prefix}{command_name}"
    # So this command is called when an user sends a dm which
    # contains "/awesome_reply"
    @on_awesome_dm_received.command
    def awesome_reply(self, data):
        return "I can send awesome dms too!"

    # user must have op permission to use this command
    @on_awesome_dm_received.command.restricted('op')
    async def awesome_tweet(self, data):
        awesome_status = " ".join(word for word in data.text.split()
                                  if word != "/awesome_tweet")
        await self.api.statuses.update.post(status=awesome_status)

        return "sent " + awesome_status

    # user must have admin or op permission to use this command
    @on_awesome_dm_received.command.restricted('admin', 'op')
    async def awesome_smiley(self, data):
        return "( ﾟ▽ﾟ)/awesome"

```


<h1 id='adv_usage'>Advanced Usage</h1>

<h2 id='adv_api'>Accessing an API using a different api version</h2>

There actually two ways:
* create a client with an `api_version` argument
* provide the api version with the subdomain of the api when creating the path to the ressource

### Create a client with a custom api version

```python
# creds being a dict with your api_keys
# notice the use of the `suffix` argument to change the default
# extension ('.json')
client = PeonyClient(**creds, api_version='1', suffix='')

# params being the parameters of the request
req = client['ads-api'].accounts[id].reach_estimate.get(**params)
```

### Add a version when creating the request

```python
# notice the use of the `_suffix` argument to change the default
# extension for a request

# using a tuple as key
req = client['ads-api', '1'].accounts[id].reach_estimate.get(_suffix='',
                                                             **kwargs)

# using a dict as key
ads = client[dict(api='ads-api', version='1')]
req = ads.accounts[id].reach_estimate.get(**kwargs, _suffix='')
```

You can also add more arguments to the tuple or dictionnary

```python
# with a dictionnary
adsapi = dict(
    api='ads-api',
    version='1',
    suffix='',
    base_url='https://{api}.twitter.com/{version}'
)

req = client[adsapi].accounts[id].reach_estimate.get(**kwargs,)


# with a tuple
ads = client['ads-api', '1', '', 'https://{api}.twitter.com/{version}']
req = ads.accounts[id].reach_estimate.get(**kwargs)
```

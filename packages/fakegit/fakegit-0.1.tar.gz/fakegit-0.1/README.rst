FakeGit is a great tool to fool yourself and others, it will modify your local git config file, deceive git to recognize the committer as somebody else.

You can use it on your own project or any repository, if you have push privilege.

Example

For example, the father of jQuery and the father of PHP is committing with a funny slogan, with my great respect and no offence for sure.

Those are real commits and will be recognized by Github and almost any git hosting websites as a user of one, if such user exists.

Installation
============
.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/hanbang-wang/FakeGit
    cd FakeGit
    python setup.py install

Or use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install fakegit

Usage
=====
.. code-block:: bash

    fakegit <command> [--user] [--help|-h]

FakeGit passes all your arguments into original Git cli, except for the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    change       Change your local identity for ever
    recover      Quickly delete 'user' params in your local git config file
    --help, -h   A brief guide

FakeGit intercepts ``--user`` with exact one arg following, which is the committer's identity.

Identity Format
---------------
For exact input, use ``name <email>`` format, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    --user 'John Doe <johndoe@example.com>'

or if you want to keep the email blank, just keep it blank:

.. code-block:: bash

    --user 'No Email <>'

I also provided a quick identity lookup for Github users, fill in name only:

.. code-block:: bash

    --user 'example'

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: bash

    fakegit commit -a -m "A example." --user hanbang-wang"

It will use Github API with the id `hanbang_wang`, which is me, lookup my commits history and my commit email, generating a format like `SuperFashi <admin@superfashi.com>` , use it to make commit messages.

But I recommend to specify a user info:

.. code-block:: bash

    fakegit commit -a -m "A example." --user "SuperFashi <admin@superfashi.com>"

of course you can use any git command by FakeGit:

.. code-block:: bash

    fakegit push --user "whateveryoulike <>"
    # same as `git push`

But it would not make any difference, since only the ``commit`` command will use `user` params.

Additions
---------

``fakegit change`` will change your local identity for ever, therefore it must followed by ``--user``, or it will throw an error.

``fakegit recover`` is a quick tool for you to delete `user` params in your local git config file, in case of tired being someone else, or need a reset after a force quit.

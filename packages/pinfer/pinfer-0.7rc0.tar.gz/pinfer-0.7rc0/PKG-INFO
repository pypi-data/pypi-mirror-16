Description: Protein Interaction Network inFERence (PINFER).
        ===============================
        
        Currently this represents a pure Python reimplementation of the approach found in Pinney et al. 2007. Full explanation of the approach can be found in the original paper, and (in time) in examples here.

        ###  Warning : This module is still very much under development!
        
        In the (nearish) future it will include useful things such as...
        
        * (more) unit testing
        * example Jupyter notebooks
        * novel functionality to enable more flexible inference of protein interaction histories
        
        When possible, advances on the original approach will be made available here.

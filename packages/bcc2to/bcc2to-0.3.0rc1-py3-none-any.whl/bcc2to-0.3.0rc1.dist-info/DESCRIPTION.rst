Bcc2To Python project
=====================

**Bcc2To** is simple *Posfix* plugin allowing to distribute list mail
individually to each list user.

**Purpose:** If you want to send mail to group of people and do not want
to redistribute ech people mail address to others, you add all those
recipients addresses to **Bcc:** field. **Bcc:** field is not included into message
headers, so recipiens do not see addresses message was sent to.
However some mail systems bans messages if your address cannot be found inside
**To:** or **Cc:** fields. This utility lets organize delivery of mail, where it
is delivered individually to each person from **Bcc:** (imaginary) field.

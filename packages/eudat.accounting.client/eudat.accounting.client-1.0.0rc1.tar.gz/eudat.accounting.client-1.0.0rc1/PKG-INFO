        eudat.accounting.client
        =======================
        
        Upload accounting records to an eudat accounting server
        
        Administrators of (storage) resources provided through the EUDAT Common Data 
        Infrastructure can use this tool to conveniently report current resource 
        consumption per registered resource. Accounting records are submitted per
        individual resource identified by its (P)ID which is available as soon as
        the resource has been registered at https://dp.eudat.eu
        
        Default settings are such that only the resource id and the consumed value 
        need to be provided. The default unit is ``byte`` and the default resource 
        type is set to ``storage``.
        The full documentation of options supported is described in the next section.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install the tool is via ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.
        It is usually best to do this in a ``virtualenv``:
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ pip install eudat.accounting.client
        
        Command line interface
        ----------------------
        
        As a result of the above there is now a console script called ``addRecord``.
        Invoke it with ``-h`` to see its usage pattern and options:
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ bin/addRecord -h
          usage: addRecord [-h] [--version] [-b BASE_URL] [-u USER] [-p PASSWORD]
                           [-d DOMAIN] [-k KEY] [-t TYPE] [-n NUMBER] [-m MEASURE_TIME]
                           [-c COMMENT] [-v]
                           account value [unit]
        
          positional arguments:
            account               account to be used. Typically the (P)ID of the
                                  resource to be accounted
            value                 The value to be recorded
            unit                  The unit of measurement for the value provided.
                                  Default: "byte"
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --version             show program's version number and exit
            -b BASE_URL, --base_url BASE_URL
                                  base URL of the accounting server to use. Default:
                                  https://accnt.eudat.eu
            -u USER, --user USER  user id used for logging into the server. If not
                                  provided it is looked up in the environment variable
                                  "ACCOUNTING_USER". Default: "" - aka not set
            -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                                  password used for logging into the server. If not
                                  provided it is looked up in the environment variable
                                  "ACCOUNTING_PW". Default: "" - aka not set
            -d DOMAIN, --domain DOMAIN
                                  name of the domain holding the account. Default: eudat
            -k KEY, --key KEY     key used to refer to the record. If not set the
                                  accounting server will create the key. Specifying an
                                  existing key will overwrite the existing record.
                                  Default: "" - not set
            -t TYPE, --type TYPE  type of the resource accounted. Default: storage
            -s SERVICE, --service SERVICE
                                  UID (or PID) of the registered service component
                                  reporting the record. Default: "" - not set
            -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
                                  number of objects associated with this accounting
                                  record. This is EUDAT specific. Default: "" - not set
            -o OBJECT_TYPE, --object_type OBJECT_TYPE
                                  object type for the number of objects specified with
                                  "-n". This is EUDAT specific. 
                                  Default: "registered objects"
            -m MEASURE_TIME, --measure_time MEASURE_TIME
                                  measurement time of the accounting record if different
                                  from the current time. Default: "" - not set
            -c COMMENT, --comment COMMENT
                                  arbitrary comment (goes into the meta dictionary).
                                  Default: "" - not set
            -v, --verbose         return the key of the accounting record created.
                                  Default: off
        
        
        Most of this should be self-explaining. Note that you need to provide credentails
        for the accounting service. If you do not have any contact the EUDAT accounting 
        manager.
        
        Basic usage information as well as error messages are logged to a file named
        ``.accounting.log`` in the current working directory from where ``addRecord``
        has been invoked.
        
        
        Developer notes
        ===============
        
        Please use a ``virtualenv`` to maintain this package, but I should not need to say that.
        
        The package can be installed directly from GitHub:
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ pip install git+git://github.com/EUDAT-DPMT/eudat.accounting.client
        
        The code is organized in a nested namespace package, i.e., the real action
        is happening in the subdirectory 
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ cd src/eudat/accounting/client
          
        Start looking around there.
        
        Run the tests (not really that meaningful so far):
        
        .. code:: console
        
          $ python setup.py test
          $ python run_tests.py

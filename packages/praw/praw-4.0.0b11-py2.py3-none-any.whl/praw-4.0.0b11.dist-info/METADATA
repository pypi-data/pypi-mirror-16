PRAW, an acronym for "Python Reddit API Wrapper", is a python package that
allows for simple access to reddit's API. PRAW aims to be easy to use and
internally follows all of `reddit's API rules
<https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API>`_. With PRAW there's no need to
introduce ``sleep`` calls in your code. Give your client an appropriate user
agent and you're set.

    pip install --pre praw

.. note:: The ``--pre`` flag is needed to install PRAW4 as it is not yet the

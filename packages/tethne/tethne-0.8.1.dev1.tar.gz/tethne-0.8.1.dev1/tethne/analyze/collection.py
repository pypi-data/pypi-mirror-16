    """
    Apply a ``method`` from NetworkX to all :ref:`networkx.Graph <networkx:graph>` objects in the
    :class:`.GraphCollection` ``G``.
    
    For options, see the `list of algorithms
    <http://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/reference/algorithms.html>`_
    in the NetworkX documentation. Not all of these have been tested.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`.GraphCollection`
        The :class:`.GraphCollection` to analyze. The specified method will be
        applied to each graph in ``G``.
    method_name : string
        Name of a method in NetworkX to execute on graph collection.
    **kwargs
        A list of keyword arguments that should correspond to the parameters
        of the specified method.

    Returns
    -------
    results : dict
        Indexed by element (node or edge) and graph index (e.g. ``date``).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If no such method exists.

    Examples
    --------

    *Betweenness centrality:* (``G`` is a :class:`.GraphCollection`\)

    Performs analysis methods from networkx.connected on each graph in the

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`.GraphCollection`
        The :class:`.GraphCollection` to analyze. The specified method will be
        applied to each graph in ``G``.
    method : string

def attachment_probability(G):
    """
    Calculates the observed attachment probability for each node at each
    time-step.
    
    
    Attachment probability is calculated based on the observed new edges in the
    next time-step. So if a node acquires new edges at time t, this will accrue
    to the node's attachment probability at time t-1. Thus at a given time,
    one can ask whether degree and attachment probability are related.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`.GraphCollection`
        Must be sliced by 'date'. See :func:`.GraphCollection.slice`\.
    
    Returns
    -------

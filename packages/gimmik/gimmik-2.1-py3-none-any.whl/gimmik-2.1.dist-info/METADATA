GiMMiK is a Python based kernel generator for
matrix multiplication kernels for various accelerator platforms.  For
small operator matrices the generated kernels are capable of
outperfoming the state-of-the-art general matrix multiplication
routines such as cuBLAS GEMM or clBLAS GEMM.  GiMMiK was originally
developed as part of Bartosz Wozniak's master's thesis in the
Department of Computing at Imperial College London and is currently
maintained by Freddie Witherden.

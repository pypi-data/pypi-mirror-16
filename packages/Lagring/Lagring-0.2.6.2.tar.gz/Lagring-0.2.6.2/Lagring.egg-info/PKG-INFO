Description: # Lagring: asset storage for Flask
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - SQLAlchemy
        - Flask
        - PostgreSQL 9.4+
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install lagring
        
        If you want to use `ImageAsset` class you have to install Pillow as well.
        
        ## How to use it
        
        0. Configure your Flask app to have necessary config options:
        
            Parameter          | Meaning
            -------------------|--------------------------------------------------
            ASSET_STORAGE_ROOT | Path to the directory where assets will be stored
            ASSET_URL_ROOT     | Asset URL invariable part
        
        1.  Create storage instance:
        
            ```python
                from lagring import FlaskLagring
        
                storage = FlaskLagring()
                storage.init_app(app)
            ```
        
        2. Derive your SQLAlchemy model from `storage.Entity` class:
        
            ```python
                from lagring import Asset
        
                class File(db.Model, storage.Entity):
                    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
                    file = Asset()
            ```
        
            Note that JSONB field `_assets` will be added to the model (PostgreSQL 9.4+).
            You can change the name by overriding `lagring.Entity.asset_data_field` method.
        
        3. Put something to that asset field:
        
            ```python
                new_file = File()
                db.session.add(new_file)
                db.session.flush()
                new_file.file = '/some/local/path/filename'
                db.session.commit()
            ```
        
            The model instance must have a valid id on asset assignment, so you have to call `flush()`
            before that.
        
        4. Then you can use the asset like this:
        
            ```python
                # get asset URL
                url = new_file.file.url
                # get asset path
                path = new_file.file.abs_path
                # delete the asset
                del new_file.file
            ```
        
        5. Besides the basic `Asset` class, there are also `ImageAsset` and `DirectoryAsset` to store
        something more specific and have some processing on upload (no docs for that yet, please see
        the code).

        Introduction
        ************
        This is a set of Python libraries that allow you to build and manage a `star schema <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema>`_ in MySQL.
        
        The star schema is a simple approach to data warehousing, which is suited to mid-size data problems.

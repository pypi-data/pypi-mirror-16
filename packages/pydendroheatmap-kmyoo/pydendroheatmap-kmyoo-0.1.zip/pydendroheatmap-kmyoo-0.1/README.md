This repository is forked from http://github.com/themantalope/pydendroheatmap by @themantalope.
The structure of the code is mostly similar, except that several more parameters have been added to allow customization of windows size, dendroheatmap size, class labels, etc.
For usage details, refer to the original repository.

This package is also uploaded to pip repository and thus can be installed by invoking

    pip install pydendroheatmap-kmyoo
    
I would like to thank @themantalope again for the great codebase to work on!

Description: *Fuchsia* reduces differential equations for Feynman master integrals to canonical form.
        
        In concrete terms, let us say we have a system of differential equations of this form:
        
            ∂f(x,ϵ)/∂x = 𝕄(x,ϵ) f(x,ϵ)
        
        where `𝕄(x,ϵ)` is a given matrix of rational functions in `x` and `ϵ`, i.e, a free variable and an infinitesimal parameter.
        Our ultimately goal is to find a column vector of unknown functions `f(x,ϵ)` as a Laurent series in `ϵ`, which satisfies our equations.
        
        With the help of *Fuchsia* we can find a transformation matrix `𝕋(x,ϵ)` which turns our system to the equivalent Fuchsian system of this form:
        
            ∂g(x,ϵ)/∂x = ϵ 𝕊(x) g(x,ϵ)
        
        where `𝕊(x) = ∑ᵢ 𝕊ᵢ/(x-xᵢ)` and `f(x,ϵ) = 𝕋(x,ϵ) g(x,ϵ)`.
        
        Such a transformation is useful, because we can easily solve the equivalent system for `g(x,ϵ)` (see [1]) and then, multiplying it by `𝕋(x,ϵ)`, find `f(x,ϵ)`.
        
        You can learn about the algorithm used in *Fuchsia* to find such transformations from Roman Lee's paper [2].
        
        *Fuchsia* is available both as a command line utility and as a (Python) library for SageMath [3].
        It will run on most Unix-like operating systems.

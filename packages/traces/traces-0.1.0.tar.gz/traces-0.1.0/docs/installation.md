# Installation

### Stable release

To install traces, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
$ pip install traces
```

This is the preferred method to install traces, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide
you through the process.

### From sources

The sources for traces can be downloaded from the [Github repo](https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces).

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces
```

Or download the [tarball](https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces/tarball/master):

```bash
$ curl -OL https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

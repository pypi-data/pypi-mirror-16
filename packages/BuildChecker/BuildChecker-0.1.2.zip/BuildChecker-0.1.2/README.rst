Helps to get notification when building your application. Used mainly while training your deep neural network.
Training your deep neural network takes atleast 48 hours and it is very tedious to log in to the server every now and then to check the status. This Build Checker can be deployed to your program and it will send a notification to your mail and phone number if there are any errors in the build.

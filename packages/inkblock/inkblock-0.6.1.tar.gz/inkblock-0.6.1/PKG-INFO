Description: Inkblock is a simpler way to create and publish writing on the web.
        
        
        
        It's true, there are a million static site generators out there.  The best five or six are better at their jobs than Inkblock is, to be honest.  But not one of them is slightly involved in the most important part of publishing online - *getting it in front of human beings*.
        
        Inkblock handles your pages, blog posts, and scheduled social posts and just makes everything work. Simply.
        
        **Notes::** I'm using this in production, but it's still pretty tuned to my needs, and needs some abstraction.  Also, the social stuff isn't in yet.  If you need something today, use Cactus.
        
        
        # Installation
        
        1. `pip install inkblock`
        2. `npm install -g firebase-tools`  Optional, to use the [firebase deploy]()
        3. `pip install picopt; brew install optipng jpeg gifsicle mozjpeg; ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/mozjpeg/2.1/bin/jpegtran /usr/local/bin/mozjpeg` Optional, to use image optimization (Mac OS X shown.)
        
        
        Me: npm install -g blaze_compiler
        
        
        # Usage
        
        
        ```bash
        $ ink new piece
        Title: The Mexican Secret of Happiness
        URL: the-mexican-secret-of-happiness [Y/n]
        
        > Piece #24 created.  Opening editor.
        
        $ 
        
        # Editing happens
        
        $ ink publish

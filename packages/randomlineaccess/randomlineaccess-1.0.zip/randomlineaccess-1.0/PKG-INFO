Description: 
        Quickly access arbitrary line numbers in a text file. A well tested library for Python 3.
        
        For example:
        
            with IndexedOpen('big_text_file.txt') as f:
                print(f[35234:35300])  # happens fast
        
        Does this by creating index files on demand of the locations of lines in a file.  The first call to a file is slow but subsequent calls are
        very quick.

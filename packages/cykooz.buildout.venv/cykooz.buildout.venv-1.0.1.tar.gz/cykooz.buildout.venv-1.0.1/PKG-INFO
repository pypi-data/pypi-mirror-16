Description: **cykooz.buildout.venv** is a `zc.buildout`_ extension that creates virtual
        python environment and use it to run buildout.
        
        .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        Add ``cykooz.buildout.venv`` to the ``extensions`` entry in your ``[buildout]``
        section::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = cykooz.buildout.venv
        
        This enables additional ``[buildout]`` option:
        
        ``venv-directory``
          This specifies the default directory where virtual environment will be
          created. Defaults to ``parts/venv``.
        
          If this directory already has a virtual python environment, then it will be
          used to run buildout without any changes.
        
        Full example
        ============
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = cykooz.buildout.venv
            venv-directory = ${buildout:parts-directory}/myvenv

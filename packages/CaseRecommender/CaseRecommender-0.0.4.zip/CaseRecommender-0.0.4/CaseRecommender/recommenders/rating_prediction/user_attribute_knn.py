"""

User Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender with Attributes

User-Attribute-kNN predicts a userâ€™s rating according to how similar users rated the same item.
The algorithm matches similar users based on the similarity of their attributes scores.

More details: http://files.grouplens.org/papers/algs.pdf

This algorithm accepts a precomputed distance matrix instead compute it inside of its code

Parameters
-----------
    distance_matrix_file: file
        Pairwise metric to compute the similarity between the users based on a set of attributes.
        Format file:
        Distances separated by \t, where the users should be ordering. E g.:
        distance1\tdistance2\tdistance3\n
        distance1\tdistance2\tdistance3\n
        distance1\tdistance2\tdistance3\n

    neighbors: int
        The number of user candidates strategy that you can choose for selecting the possible items to recommend.

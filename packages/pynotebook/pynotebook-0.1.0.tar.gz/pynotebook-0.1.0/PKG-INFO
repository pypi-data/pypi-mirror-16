        ==========
        
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Pynotebook is a command shell for interactive computing following the
        "notebook" concept. Notebooks originally appeared with the program
        Mathematica and became famous for python with the iPython/Jupyter
        project. Unlike iPython, pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c
        extensions or anything except python and wx. It is a python module,
        runs out of the box and therefore is easy to embed and distribute.
        
        Most notable features of pynotebook are:
        
        - syntax highlighting
        - command completion (tab-key)
        - matplotlib plotting
        - BSD-license
        
        
        There are a couple of demo applications: 
        - a plotting demo
        - a notebook interface to gnu r
        
        The later demonstrates how to completely modify the notebook. It uses
        rpy2 for interfacing gnu r and pygments for colorization.
        
        Basic usage
        -----------
        
        ::
        
            >>> from pynotebook.nbview import NBView
            >>> import wx
            >>> app = wx.App()
            >>> frame = wx.Frame(None)
            >>> view = NBView(frame)
            >>> frame.Show()
            >>> app.MainLoop()

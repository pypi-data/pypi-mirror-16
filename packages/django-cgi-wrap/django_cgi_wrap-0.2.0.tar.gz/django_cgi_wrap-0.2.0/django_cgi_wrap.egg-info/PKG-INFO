        Simple function to wrap old-style CGI scripts/binaries to integrate them
        into the views of a django app.
        
        This method preserves the shortcommings of the CGI deployment, but may be adequate
        when the performance hit caused by CGI spawning a new process for each request is
        negligible, a legacy CGI executable needs to be embedded in a new application or
        the ease of deployment is a priority.
        
        Data returned by the CGI will be streamed to the client.
        
        Example:
        
        .. code::
        
            from django_cgi_wrap import cgi_wrap
        
            def example_view(request):
                return cgi_wrap(request, "/usr/bin/mapserv")
        
        
        Also see the "tests" directory for a working example as well as the doc-strings of the
        module itself.

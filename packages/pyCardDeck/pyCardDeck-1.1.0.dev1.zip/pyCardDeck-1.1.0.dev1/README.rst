Library aimed at anyone who wants to do any kind of deck manipulation in python.
So probably game developers. The goal is to have the ultimate library for all of this,
supporting all kinds of game types with clean and beautiful API - kind of like requests :)

For developers
--------------

The library will support only Python 3 and up, with py.test as the only required library.
Always aim to write clean and readable code, make sure your tests are passing, document in docstrings (rst format)
and when writing new modules, classes or functions, add them to docs (we are using Shpinx autodocs)

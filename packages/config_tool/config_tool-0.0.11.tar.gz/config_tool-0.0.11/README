This tool allows the user to easily read, write and validate a JSON
file from command line as well as from a python script which imports
the Config class.



============================
USAGE (FROM THE COMMANDLINE)
============================



Given a configuration file (sample.json):

-----------------------------------------

{
    "foo":{
        "bar":1
    }
}

-----------------------------------------




We can create a shell script (reader.sh) like this:

---------------------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash

foo_bar="$(config --read --key foo.bar --config ./sample.json)"

echo "foo.bar:$foo_bar"

---------------------------------------------------




Executing this script will return this:

---------------------------------------

root# reader.sh

foo.bar:1

---------------------------------------

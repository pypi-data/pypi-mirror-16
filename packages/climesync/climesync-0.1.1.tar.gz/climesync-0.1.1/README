CLI for the TimeSync API

Climesync is a CLI frontend to submit times to a TimeSync implementation.

IMPORTANT: Please upgrade your setuptools before installing ClimeSync, 
we recommend version >= 23.1.0 

$ pip install -U setuptools

To run the program, type

$ climesync

climesync accepts args like so:

$ climesync --connect <timesync baseurl> --user <username> --password <password>

or with short options:

$ climesync -c <timesync baseurl> -u <username> -p <password>

If all three args are provided, climesync will connect to timesync and
authenticate your username and password for you.
    

Once climesync is running, you can complete the following tasks:

c - connect
dc - disconnect
s - sign in
so - sign out/reset credentials

ct - submit time
ut - update time
gt - get times
st - sum times

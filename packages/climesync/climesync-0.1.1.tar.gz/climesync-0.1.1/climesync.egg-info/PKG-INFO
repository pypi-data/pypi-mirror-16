Description: CLI for the TimeSync API
        
        Climesync is a CLI frontend to submit times to a TimeSync implementation.
        
        IMPORTANT: Please upgrade your setuptools before installing ClimeSync, 
        we recommend version >= 23.1.0 
        
        $ pip install -U setuptools
        
        To run the program, type
        
        $ climesync
        
        climesync accepts args like so:
        
        $ climesync --connect <timesync baseurl> --user <username> --password <password>
        
        or with short options:
        
        $ climesync -c <timesync baseurl> -u <username> -p <password>
        
        If all three args are provided, climesync will connect to timesync and
        authenticate your username and password for you.
            
        
        Once climesync is running, you can complete the following tasks:
        
        c - connect
        dc - disconnect
        s - sign in
        so - sign out/reset credentials
        
        ct - submit time
        ut - update time
        gt - get times
        st - sum times
        dt - delete time
        
        cp - create project
        up - update project
        gp - get projects
        dp - delete project
        
        ca - create activity
        ua - update activity
        ga - get activities
        da - delete activity
        
        cu - create user
        uu - update user
        gu - get users
        du - delete user
        
        q - exit

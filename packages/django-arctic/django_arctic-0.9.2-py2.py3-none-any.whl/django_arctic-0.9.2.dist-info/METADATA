#Django Arctic

Django Arctic is a framework that simplifies the creation of custom content management systems.
It also includes a collection of optional components for common use cases, and
its core infrastructure is implementation agnostic.

##Why

There are a lot of content management systems in the market that are a good fit for the implementation of many web sites. Most CMS systems make assumptions about the data model for posts, authentication and the administration interface.

There is however a tipping point, where the need to customize a CMS product
is extensive enough that it ends up creating a more complex implementation than
if the product was developed directly with a generic framework. This is
specially true when the core of a CMS needs to be changed.

This is the case that Arctic wants to solve, creation of a CMS with a high degree of customization. Instead of being a ready-to-use CMS, Arctic is a framework that facilitates the construction of content management systems.

Installation
------------

Using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org>`_::
    
    [sudo] pip3 install mps-youtube

Installing youtube_dl is highly recommended::

    [sudo] pip3 install youtube_dl

Additional Mac OS X installation notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
Install mplayer with `MacPorts <http://www.macports.org>`_::

    sudo port install MPlayer

Or with `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_::

    brew install mplayer

Additional Windows installation notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to installing with pip, there is a standalone binary available. Go to `Releases <https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/releases>`_ and download mpsyt-VERSION.exe under downloads for the latest release.

Install the python `colorama <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama>`_ module to get colors (optional)::

    pip3 install colorama

Download mplayer for your CPU type from the "Build Selection table" `here <http://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer-win32.php>`_.

Extract the ``mplayer.exe`` file, saving it to the folder that ``mpsyt.exe`` resides in (usually ``C:\PythonXX\Scripts\``) or to a folder in the system path.

Alternatively to mplayer, use ``mpv.exe`` which can be downloaded from: http://mpv.io/installation/

Run via Docker container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using `Docker <http://www.docker.com>`_, run with::

    sudo docker run -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd -it --rm --privileged --name mpsyt mpsyt

Additional Docker notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to locally build the container you can run the following steps

Check out this repo::

    git clone https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube.git

Enter the directory and run docker build::

    cd mps-youtube
    sudo docker build -t mpsyt .

Now run the container interactively with::

    sudo docker run -v /dev/snd:/dev/snd -it --rm --privileged --name mpsyt mpsyt

In order to have access to the local sound device (/dev/snd) the container needs to be privileged.

XD-Docker
=========

XD-Docker aims at providing an easy to use and Pythonic API for working with
the Docker Remote API in Python.


Development status
------------------

This library is in a early development stage, with only limited functionality
of the Docker Remote API implemented, and with no guarantees of API stability.

The functionality that is implemented, should be pretty stable though, with
unit and integration tests in place.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is build with Sphinx, and is hosted on http://readthedocs.org

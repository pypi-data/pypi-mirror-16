XD-Docker
=========

XD-Docker aims at providing an easy to use and Pythonic API for working with
the Docker Remote API in Python.


Development status
------------------

This library is in a early development stage, with only limited functionality
of the Docker Remote API implemented, and with no guarantees of API stability.

The functionality that is implemented, should be pretty stable though, with
unit and integration tests in place.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation will be hosted on http://readthedocs.org when I have finished
the setup for that.

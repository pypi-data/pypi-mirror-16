The SUbtitle adJUSTER
=====================

If you have an .srt subtitle file which JUST WON'T FIT, then you can adjust
the timings using the sujuster.

Sorry for the bad name, I have a real skill of picking really really bad names
for projects.

1.0.3
-----

- update package categories in PyPI


1.0.2 & 1.0.1
-------------

- change executable name to "sujust" as intended originally
- took more than one try. it's late.


1.0.0

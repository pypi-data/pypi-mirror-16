        Pymunk is a easy-to-use pythonic 2d physics library that can be used whenever 
        you need 2d rigid body physics from Python. It is built on top of the very 
        capable 2d physics library Chipmunk.

        This release is based on the latest Pymunk release (5.0.0), 
        using Chipmunk 7.0 rev d7603e3927 (source included)

        :Getting the latest source:

        Installation
        ------------
        
        In the normal case pymunk can be installed with pip::
        
            > pip install pymunk
        
        It has one (or two) dependencies. CFFI and if not on Windows or OSX you also 
        need a working gcc compiler.
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Quick code example::
            
            import pymunk               # Import pymunk..
        
            space = pymunk.Space()      # Create a Space which contain the simulation
            space.gravity = 0,-1000     # Set its gravity
        
            body = pymunk.Body(1,1666)  # Create a Body with mass and moment
            body.position = 50,100      # Set the position of the body
        
            poly = pymunk.Poly.create_box(body) # Create a box shape and attach to body
            space.add(body, poly)       # Add both body and shape to the simulation
        
            while True:                 # Infinite loop simulation
                space.step(0.02)        # Step the simulation one step forward
            
        For more detailed and advanced examples, take a look at the included demos 
        (in examples/).
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The source distribution of Pymunk ships with a number of demos in the examples
        directory, and it also contains the full documentaiton including API reference.
        
        You can also find the full documentation including examples and API reference 
        on the pymunk homepage, http://www.pymunk.org
        
        
        Dependencies / Requirements
        ---------------------------
        
        Basically Pymunk have been made to be as easy to install and distribute as 
        possible, usually `pip install` will take care of everything for you.
        
        - Python (Runs on CPython 2.7 and 3.X. Pypy and Pypy3)
        - Chipmunk (Source included, and on Windows and OSX its already compiled)
        - CFFI (will be installed automatically by Pip)
        - Setuptools (should be included with Pip)
        
        * GCC and friends (optional, you need it to compile Chipmunk)
        * Pygame (optional, you need it to run the Pygame based demos)
        * Pyglet (optional, you need it to run the Pyglet based demos)
        * Matplotlib & Jupyter Notebook (optional, you need it to run the Matplotlib 
          based demos)
        * Sphinx (optional, you need it to build documentation)
        
        
        Chipmunk
        --------
        
        Pymunk is built on top of the c library Chipmunk. It uses CFFI to interface
        with the Chipmunk library file. Because of this Chipmunk has to be compiled
        before it can be used with Pymunk. Compilation has to be done with GCC or 
        another compiler that uses the same flags. 
        
        The source distribution does not include a precompiled Chipmunk library file, 
        instead you need to build it yourself. 
        
        There are basically two options, either building it automatically as part of 
        installation using for example Pip::
        
            > pip install pymunk-source-dist.zip
        
        Or if you have the source unpacked / you got pymunk by cloning its git repo, 
        you can explicitly tell pymunk to compile it inplace::    
        
            > python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        
        Note that chipmunk is actually not built as a python extension, but distutils /
        setuptools doesnt currently handle pure native libraries that needs to be built 
        in a good way if built with build_clib.
        
        The compiled file goes into the /pymunk folder (same as space.py, 
        body.py and others).

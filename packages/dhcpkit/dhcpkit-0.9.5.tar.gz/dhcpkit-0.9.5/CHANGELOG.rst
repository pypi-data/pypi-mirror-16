0.9.5 - 2016-08-11
------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- 2.5x speed improvement.

Changes for developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :meth:`.ProtocolElement.parse` and the :meth:`~.ProtocolElement.load_from` methods it uses no longer call
  :meth:`.ProtocolElement.validate` because every (nested) element validating everything all the time is rather
  inefficient. Now callers are supposed to call :meth:`.ProtocolElement.validate` themselves (if they want to).
- We no longer use :mod:`abc` and :class:`~abc.ABCMeta`. It turned out that all the run-time validation it did caused a
  Â±20% slow down.


0.9.4 - 2016-08-04
------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for the :rfc:`6939` client link-layer address relay option
- Added support for the :rfc:`4580` subscriber-id relay option
- Added support for the :rfc:`6334` DS-Lite AFTR tunnel endpoint name option
- Added support for the :rfc:`7598` MAP options
- Added support for :mod:`~dhcpkit.ipv6.extensions.linklayer_id` and :mod:`~dhcpkit.ipv6.extensions.subscriber_id` in
  :ref:`static-csv` and :ref:`static-sqlite`

Fixes
^^^^^

- Fix error where command line log-level argument was ignored.
- Fix error that caused every message to be interpreted as received-over-multicast
- Don't block when the inbound queue is full, just drop the message and continue
- Fixed an interface-id parsing bug in :ref:`static-csv` and :ref:`static-sqlite`
- Allow UnknownOption in all options, otherwise we reject messages with options that contain unknown sub-options


0.9.3 - 2016-07-27
------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- Not all systems have a ``wheel`` group anymore, so don't use that as a default group for the control socket.
- Linux doesn't support SIGINFO, and its functionality has become redundant with the new control socket functionality,
  so remove SIGINFO handling.

Changes for users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Critical errors are now always shown on `stderr`. Otherwise the server could crash without the user seeing the reason.


0.9.2 - 2016-07-27
------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- A packaging error slipped through the checks, and it turns out that crucial XML files weren't packaged in previous
  0.9.x versions. This has now been fixed.


0.9.1 - 2016-07-27
------------------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It is now possible to use IDNs everywhere in DHCPKit, including configuration files.
- Implement a domain socket to control the server process.
- Added :ref:`ipv6-dhcpctl` to control the server process through the domain socket.
- Added a configuration section ``<statistics>`` to specify categories that you would like statistics on. Currently it is
  possible to gather statistics per interface, client subnet or relay.
- Added ``stats`` and ``stats-json`` commands for `ipv6-dhcpctl`.

Changes for users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Create PID file /var/run/ipv6-dhcpd.pid by default.
- Create domain socket /var/run/ipv6-dhcpd.sock control the server by default.

Changes for developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) in :meth:`~dhcpkit.utils.parse_domain_bytes` and
  :meth:`~dhcpkit.utils.encode_domain`.
- Created ForOtherServerError as a subclass of CannotRespondError, to enable more accurate logging, and to make it
  possible to gather better statistics.
- Replaced :attr:`.IncomingPacketBundle.interface_id` ``bytes``
  with :attr:`~.IncomingPacketBundle.interface_name` ``str``,
  providing :attr:`~.IncomingPacketBundle.interface_id` for backwards compatibility.
- Added :attr:`~.TransactionBundle.relays` property to more easily enumerate all the relays a message went through.
- Moved responsibility of creating the :class:`.TransactionBundle` from the :class:`.MessageHandler` to :mod:`.worker`.
  It gives a cleaner API and helps with statistics counting.
- Added :mod:`.statistics` and updated :mod:`.worker` and :class:`.MessageHandler` to update relevant counters.


0.9.0 - 2016-07-16
------------------

- A complete rewrite of the DHCPv6 server with a new configuration style.

Description: barrett
        -------
        
        barrett is a software package meant to replace getplots in the [SuperBayeS](http://superbayes.org/)
        package. Main differential feature is out-of-core processing so the
        code can handle very large datasets.
        
        Specific technologies: HDF5, and Python (h5py, numpy, matplotlib).
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        barrett is split into four submodules:
        
         + barrett.data implements methods for modifying data (e.g. log, change units) or calculate
           depended variables (e.g. mean squark mass)
        
         + barrett.posterior is for calculating and plot the one or two dimensional marginal
           posterior distribution.
        
         + barrett.profilelikelihood is for calculating and plot the one or two dimensional profile
           likelihood.
        
         + barrett.util contain various utility functions most notable convert_chain() which converts
           the plain text MultiNest output to the HDF5 format used by barrett.
        
        As for parallelisation; writing to the same hdf5 file is strongly discouraged. Reading the file
        is however perfectly fine. So posterior/profilelikelihood module is perfectly parallelisable.
        
        The code is not parallelised, instead I recommend using Python's multiprocessing module to
        producing several plots asynchronously. In most system tested the analysis is CPU bound, your
        mileage may vary.
        
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Please check the example directory for plot.py for an, you guessed it, example.

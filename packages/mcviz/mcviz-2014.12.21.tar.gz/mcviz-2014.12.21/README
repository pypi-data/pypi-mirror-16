Preface
-------

Welcome! `MCViz` was started at the _European School of High Energy Physics 2010_,
during a `pythia` lecture where a couple of confused students were staring at a
list of a thousand particles particicpating in a 
[QCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) event.

"What does this *look* like?!", we asked ourselves. We realised in short order 
that a few simple instructions to the excellent [graphviz](http://graphviz.org), 
we could see the connections between everything before our eyes.

.. very quickly we found ourselves knee-deep in ideas and desire to explore the
beautiful mess infront of us. `MCViz` is the result of our exploration.

`MCViz` is intended to be a tool for novices to have a quick play around in, or 
for more serious users and people who need to explore generator information
to make sense of what is going on.

Now go to [Wiki](https://github.com/mcviz/mcviz/wiki) for a quick start!

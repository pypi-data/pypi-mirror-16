The mriqc package provides a series of :abbr:`NR (no-reference)`,
:abbr:`IQMs (image quality metrics)` to used in :abbr:`QAPs (quality
assessment protocols)` for :abbr:`MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)`.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure you have FSL and AFNI installed, and the binaries available in
the system's $PATH.

Installation
------------

The easiest path is using pypi ::

    pip install mriqc


Example
-------

::

    mriqc -i ~/Data/bids_dataset -o out/ -w work/

MRIQC provides a series of image processing workflows to extract and compute a series of
NR (no-reference), IQMs (image quality metrics) to be used in QAPs (quality assessment
protocols) for MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
This open-source neuroimaging data processing tool is being developed as a part of the
MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by the CRN. This pipeline derives
from, and is heavily influenced by, the PCP Quality Assessment Protocol.
This tool extracts a series of IQMs from structural and functional MRI data. It is also
scheduled to add diffusion MRI to the target imaging families.

Fro
===

Fro is a Python module for parsing strings and text into Python objects. It
offers a concise, declarative, and expressive interface for mapping strings to
data, abstracting away boilerplate code and making it easy to quickly write
bug-free parsers.

Fro is compatible with Python 2.7+ and Python 3.x, and can be installed via pip.
Documentation for the module can be found at `<http://pythonhosted.org/fro>`_.

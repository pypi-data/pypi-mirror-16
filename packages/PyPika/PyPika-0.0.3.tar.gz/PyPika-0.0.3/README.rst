**PyPika** is a Python API for for building queries.  The motivation behind **PyPika** is to provide a simple syntax for
building queries but does not limit the flexibility of handwritten SQL.  Most other querybuilders were built with ORM in
mind and are limited to selecting columns and provide only limited join functionality.  **PyPika** was designed around
data analysis and provides syntax for building queries with arithmetic, complex expressions, nested functions,
subqueries and joins.  It is also easily extended to take full advantage of specific features of SQL database vendors.

Pootle FS

Pootle FS allows to synchronize Pootle against a filesystem, or VCS, allowing
to handle conflicts and several other situations that previously required
ad-hoc hacks.

Command changes and additions
-----------------------------

- :djadmin:`run_cherrypy` has been removed.
- :djadmin:`start` has been removed, use :djadmin:`runserver` instead.
- :djadmin:`verify_user` and :djadmin:`purge_user` now accept multiple
  usernames.
- :djadmin:`refresh_scores` now recalculates user scores and accepts
  multiple usernames.
- :djadmin:`contributors` has two new options
  :option:`--since <contributors --since>` and
  ``--only-emails``.
- :djadmin:`list_serializers` has been added to view serializers and
  deserializers installed on your system.
- :djadmin:`flush_cache` flushes ``default``, ``redis``, ``stats`` caches,
  accepts :option:`--rqdata <flush_cache --rqdata>`,
  :option:`--stats <flush_cache --stats>`,
  :option:`--django-cache <flush_cache --django-cache>` options.

Changes in settings
-------------------

- :setting:`POOTLE_SCORE_COEFFICIENTS` accepts custom settings for user
  scores calculation.
- :setting:`POOTLE_TM_SERVER` no longer receives the ``MIN_SCORE`` parameter, as
  it was misleading and had questionable effects.
- :setting:`POOTLE_TM_SERVER` now accepts a ``MIN_SIMILARITY`` parameter, to
  filter out results which might be irrelevant. To learn more, check the
  documenation on :setting:`MIN_SIMILARITY <POOTLE_TM_SERVER-MIN_SIMILARITY>`.
- :setting:`POOTLE_EXPORT_VIEW_LIMIT` was added, with a default value of 10000.
  This restricts how many units are shown in export views.
- :setting:`POOTLE_SEARCH_BACKEND` was added, to allow configuring the search
  backend to be used.

ad-hoc hacks.

- :djadmin:`verify_user` and :djadmin:`purge_user` now accept multiple
  usernames.
- :djadmin:`refresh_scores` now recalculates user scores and accepts
  multiple usernames.
- :djadmin:`contributors` command has been refactored in order to return more
  accurate results and has new options
  :option:`--since <contributors --since>`,
  :option:`--until <contributors --until>` and
  :option:`--mailmerge <contributors --mailmerge>`. The ``--from-revision``
  option has been removed.
- :djadmin:`list_serializers` has been added to view serializers and
  deserializers installed on your system.
- :djadmin:`flush_cache` flushes ``default``, ``redis``, ``stats`` caches,

Changes in settings
-------------------

- :setting:`POOTLE_SCORE_COEFFICIENTS` accepts custom settings for user
  scores calculation.
- :setting:`POOTLE_TM_SERVER` no longer receives the ``MIN_SCORE`` parameter, as
  it was misleading and had questionable effects.
- :setting:`POOTLE_TM_SERVER` now accepts a ``MIN_SIMILARITY`` parameter, to
  filter out results which might be irrelevant. To learn more, check the
  documenation on :setting:`MIN_SIMILARITY <POOTLE_TM_SERVER-MIN_SIMILARITY>`.
- :setting:`POOTLE_EXPORT_VIEW_LIMIT` was added, with a default value of 10000.
  This restricts how many units are shown in export views.
- :setting:`POOTLE_SEARCH_BACKEND` was added, to allow configuring the search
  backend to be used.

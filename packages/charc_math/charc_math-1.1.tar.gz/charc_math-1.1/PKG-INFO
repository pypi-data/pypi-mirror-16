Description: # charc_math
        
        This started out as a private collection of maths functions, many will be quite simple. Over time I've got quite a few, and I thought it should be shared. Nothing is too complicated - I hope.
        
        __tl;dr__ Maths functions.
        
        ## Code Example
        
        ```Python
        import charc_math as c
        
        print c.primes(10):
        #Output [2, 3, 5, 7] 
        ```
        
        Each function comes with a suffiecient docstring, including what arguments it takes and what it returns.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Each function here has at some point been written and used by me to solve various maths problems, from ProjectEuler, to PythonChallenge, to my own recreational maths work.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```Bash
        sudo pip install charc_math
        ```
        
        ```Python
        import charc_math
        # as you normally would...
        ```
        
        ## Tests
        
        Each one has gone through a decent amount of testing before finally being put into this proper collection. If you find any bugs contact me at the email provided and I'll look into it.
        
        ```Python
        def test_primes():
        	assert_equal(primes(100),[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97])
        	assert_equal(primes(2),[2])
        	assert_equal(primes(-10),[])
        	assert_equal(primes(1),[])
        ```
        
        ## Contributors
        
        So far just me. I'd like to thank any of my friends who will have without a doubt readover at least one of these files just to make sure it has no typos or anything else stupid.

        __Basically__ I don't care what you do with the code so long as you:
        
        - [ ] don't ~~try to pass it off as your own~~ _(lol, I know just how basic it is.)_
        - [x] give me credit
        
        ##TODO
        
        - [ ] Finish porting all of this from everywhere into one place
        - [ ] Work on more common maths functions
        - [ ] Speed - _not the drug or the film_
        - [x] Sort out the README page
        - [ ] ???
        
        Contact me if you want to add more things to that list.
        
        #### Known Bugs
        Each bug I find is with the function, but still a general list for those unwilling to read (including me)
        - isAP is ~~not very numerically accurate~~ better now.
        - isGP is not at all numerically accurate, this needs lots of work and fixing

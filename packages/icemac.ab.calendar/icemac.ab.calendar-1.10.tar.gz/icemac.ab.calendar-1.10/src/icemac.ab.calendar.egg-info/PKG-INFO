         Changelog
        ===========
        
        1.10 (2016-08-28)
        =================
        
        - Add some infrastructure for `icemac.ab.calexport`.
        
        
        1.9 (2016-06-25)
        ================
        
        - Allow to restrict which persons are listed in the person list on the event
          using: Master Data > Calendar > Settings > Person keyword.
        
        
        1.8 (2016-04-16)
        ================
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        - Fix a bug with daylight saving time adding one hour to each event during DST.
        
        - Normalize non-recurring events to UTC to fix possibly wrong local time zone
          values. **Caution:** Some events could not be fixed because they already have
          a wrong time with the UTC time zone. But only some of the events with a UTC
          time zone seem to have this offset. These ones have to be fixed by hand.
          Sorry for the inconvenience.
        
        - Listing of recurring events in calendar master data no longer displays a time
          for whole-day events.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add a special style sheet for printing to render the calendar as a list on
          paper. (Works in Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome and
          Internet Explorer >= 10.x)
        
        
        1.7.1 (2016-03-12)
        ==================
        
        - Bugfix: Since 1.7.0 locally defined calendar users no longer where able to
          edit events.
        
        1.7.0 (2016-03-05)
        ==================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Add new `daily` recurrence for recurring events.
        
        - Add end date to recurring events.
        
        - Newlines in the `nodes` field now lead to new items in the calendar view for
          each line.
        
        - Allow events to take place the whole day.
        
        Bugfixes
        --------
        
        - Selecting a user defined field for display in calendar view resulted in an
          error when displaying recurred events.
        
        Other
        -----
        
        - No longer use `unittest2` as it was included in Python 2.7.
        
        - Lint JS code.
        
        - Use py.test as new test runner.
        
        - Use package `icemac.recurrence` which was extracted for reuse from here.

.TH adt\-virt-lxd 1 2013 "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
adt\-virt\-lxd \- autopkgtest virtualisation server using LXD

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B adt\-virt\-lxd
.RI [ options ]
.I image
.RI [ "-- extra lxc launch args..." ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B adt-virt-lxd
provides an autopkgtest virtualisation server using LXD. It creates temporary
containers from the given LXD image name.

Normally
.B adt-virt-lxd
will be invoked by
.BR adt-run .

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.B adt-virt-lxd
makes no strict assumptions about the image. However, it is highly
recommended that the image has eatmydata installed, or at least that gets
installed via setup commands.

For production use, it is recommended to use
.BR adt-build-lxd (1)
to generate an optimized image with autopkgtest's standard setup commands
applied. Then these setup commands don't need to be applied for every test.
This is particularly necessary if you want to use
.B --apt-source
tests, i. e. use
.B apt-get source
in the test bed to download the package to test. Standard images from
.B linuxcontainers.org
do not have "deb-src" apt sources by default.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI -r " remote" " | --remote=" remote
Run container on given remote host instead of locally. See
.B lxc remote list
for available remotes.

.TP
.BR \-d " | " \-\-debug
Enables debugging output.

.PP
You can pass additional options to
.B lxd launch\fR:
Anything after a
.B --
gets appended verbatim to
.BI "lxc launch " image\fR.

.SH INPUT, OUTPUT AND EXIT STATUS
The behaviour of
.B adt-virt-lxd
is as described by the AutomatedTesting virtualisation regime
specification.

.SH EXAMPLE

Show available images on the standard
.B linuxcontainers.org
remote image server:

.RS
.EX
lxc image list images:
.EE
.RE

Run the tests of a local built directory tree on the current Debian sid
image from the above
.B images:
remote:

.RS
.EX
adt-run my-package/ --- lxd images:debian/sid/amd64
.EE
.RE

Run the tests in a local built directory tree from a local LXD image
.B desktop/i386\fR,
ensuring that eatmydata is installed:

.RS
.EX
adt-run --setup-commands 'apt-get install -y eatmydata' dir/to/test/ \\
  --- lxd desktop/i386
.EE
.RE

Run the tests of the
.B libpng
package on the current Debian sid image from the
.B images:
remote on a remote armhf host:

.RS
.EX
lxc remote add armhf-test http://armhf.testlab.example.com:8443
adt-run --setup-commands=setup-testbed libpng --- \\
   lxd --remote armhf-test images:debian/sid/armhf
.EE
.RE

Build a local image with standard setup commands pre-applied from a remote
standard image, and run libpng test in it:

.RS
.EX
adt-build-lxd images:ubuntu/xenial/amd64
adt-run libpng --- lxd adt/ubuntu/xenial/amd64

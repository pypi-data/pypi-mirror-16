filesysobjects
==============

The 'filesysobjects' package provides utilities for the application of
basic object oriented features onto filesystems.
This includes basic coverage of the 'inspect' package for the simplified
gathering of information on packages, modules, and files.

The provided feature modules comprise the following list.
For code examples refer to 'filesysobjects.UseCases'.

The package 'filesysobjects' is a spin off from the project 'UnifiedSessionsManager-2.0',
see 'https://sourceforge.net/projects/ctys/'.

The main interface classes are:

* **FileSysObjects** - Filesystem objects.

For UseCases refer to subdirectory:

* UseCases

setup.py
--------

The installer adds a few options to the standard setuptools options.

* *build_sphinx*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Sphinx, html only. Calls 'callDocSphinx.sh'.

* *build_epydoc*: Creates documentation for runtime system by Epydoc, html only. Calls 'callDocEpydoc.sh'.

* *instal_doc*: Install a local copy of the previously build documents in accordance to PEP-370.

* *test*: Runs PyUnit tests by discovery.

* *--help-filesysobjects*: Displays this help.

* *--no-install-required*: Suppresses installation dependency checks, requires appropriate PYTHONPATH.

* *--offline*: Sets online dependencies to offline, or ignores online dependencies.

* *--exit*: Exit 'setup.py'.

After successful installation the 'selftest' verifies basic checks by:

  *filesysobjects --selftest*

with the exit value '0' when OK.

The option '-v' raises the degree of verbosity for inspection

  *filesysobjects --selftest -v -v -v -v*

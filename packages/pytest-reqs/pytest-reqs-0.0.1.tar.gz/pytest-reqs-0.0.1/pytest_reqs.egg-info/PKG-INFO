Description: py.test plugin for checking requirements files
        ==================================================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        This plugin checks your requirements files for specific versions, and compares
        those versions with the installed libraries in your environment, failing your
        test suite if any are invalid or out of date.
        
        This is useful for keeping virtual environments up-to-date, and ensuring that
        your test suite is always being passed with the requirements you have
        specified.
        
        It also has the added bonus of verifying that your requirements files are
        syntatically valid.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        install via::
        
            pip install pytest-reqs
        
        if you then type::
        
            py.test --reqs
        
        it will search for dependencies in the files matching:
        
        - ``req*.txt``
        - ``req*.pip``
        - ``requirements/*.txt``
        - ``requirements/*.pip``
        
        and the declared dependencies will be checked against the current environment.
        
        A little example
        ----------------
        
        If your environment has dependencies installed like this::
        
            $ pip freeze
            foo==0.9.9
        
        But you have a ``requirements.txt`` file like this::
        
            foo==1.0.0
        
        you can run ``py.test`` with the plugin installed::
        
            $ py.test --reqs
            =================================== FAILURES ===================================
            ______________________________ requirements-check ______________________________
            Distribution "foo" requires foo==1.0.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1)) but 0.9.9 is installed
        
        
        It also handles ``pip``'s version containment syntax (e.g, ``foo<=1.0.0``,
        ``foo>=1.0.0``, etc)::
        
            $ py.test --reqs
            =================================== FAILURES ===================================
            ______________________________ requirements-check ______________________________
            Distribution "foo" requires foo>=1.0.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1)) but 0.9.9 is installed
        
        
        Furthermore, it will tell you if your requirements file is invalid (for
        example, if there is not enough ``=`` symbols)::
        
            $ py.test --reqs
            ______________________________ requirements-check ______________________________
            Invalid requirement: 'foo=1.0.0' (from -r requirements.pip)
        
        Running requirements checks and no other tests
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        You can also restrict your test run to only perform "reqs" tests and not any
        other tests by typing::
        
            py.test --reqs -m reqs
        
        This will only run test items with the "reqs" marker which this plugin adds
        dynamically.

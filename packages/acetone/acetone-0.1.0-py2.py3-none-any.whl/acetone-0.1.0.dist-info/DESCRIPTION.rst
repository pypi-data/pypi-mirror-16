acetone library
===============

About
-----

Glue code removal. Acetone is a python library to provide inversion of
control in situation where other methods are inconvenient or they are
not even possible. Or you just like the library.

Usage
-----

Create the acetone container somewhere in your application:

.. code:: python

    # dependencies.py

    from acetone import AcetoneContainer

    dependencies = AcetoneContainer()
    # or ioc_container
    # or lord_of_the_dependencies
    # or services

Then use it:

.. code:: python

    # class_with_dependency.py

    from dependencies import dependencies

    class ClassWithSomeDependency(object):
        # you can use strings or types as a key
        dependency = dependencies.Dependency('key')

        def use_the_dependency(self):
            self.dependency.dependency_call('argument')

Create a dependency implementation:

.. code:: python

    # dependency_implementation.py

    class DependencyImplementation(object):
        def dependency_call(self, argument):
            print(argument)

Later register the implementation and run it!

.. code:: python

    # __main__.py

    from dependencies import dependencies
    from class_with_dependency import ClassWithSomeDependency
    from dependency_implementation import DependencyImplementation


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        dependency_implementation = DependencyImplementation()
        dependencies.register_instance('key', dependency_implementation)

        instance = ClassWithSomeDependency()
        instance.use_the_dependency()

Or load it from a file:

.. code:: json

    [
        {
            "name": "key",
            "module": "dependency_implementation",
            "factory": "DependencyImplementation",
            "singleton": true
        }
    ]

.. code:: python

    import json
    from dependencies import dependencies

    def main():
        with open('configuration.json') as file:
            content = json.load(file)
            dependencies.load_from_dicts(content)

        instance = ClassWithSomeDependency()
        instance.use_the_dependency()

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

How fast is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's very fast. It's even faster then a builtin property. The very first
dependency access requires some initialization for its own setup and
dependency creation (provided it was not created before), but the
subsequent calls are as fast as a member instance access. Dependencies
use a descriptor protocol (used by ``@property``), they are initialized
lazily and once fetched from the container they are set as a normal
instance member (class member in case of ClassDependency). This trick is
used by several frameworks (for example werkzeuq cached\_property).

How do I mock it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technically you can mock it, but I don't think it's necessary. The
container is simple and well tested. Its purpose is to provide a
requested dependency and the dependency can be a mock as well. You can
just consider it as an essential part of your code and not mock it to
your advantage (would you mock properties?).

.. code:: python

    class TestXyz(TestCase):
        def tearDown(self):
            container.clean()

Traditionalists wouldn't agree for sure but Python wasn't created by
traditionalists in the first place.

Are there any requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No external dependencies. For the class used the only requirement is
that the class has to be a normal python class with ``__dict__``. In
other words it can't use ``__slots__``.

        ======
        
        This repo is actually not directly related to Taylor Swift.  It's just a simple
        Python API for getting lyrics from MetroLyrics.  Here is how easy it is:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from tswift import Artist
            import random
        
            tswift = Artist('taylor-swift')
            song = random.choice(tswift.songs)
            print(song.lyrics)
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        This package depends on ``lxml`` and ``requests``.  These should be installed
        when you install this package from pip:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install tswift
        
        After installing, you can also print a random Taylor Swift song lyric with the
        command:
        
        .. code::
        
            python -m tswift
        
        Happy lyric hunting!

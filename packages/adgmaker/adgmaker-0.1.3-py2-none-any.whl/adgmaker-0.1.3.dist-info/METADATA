|ADGMaker!| # ADGMaker

Automatically create and install hundreds of awesome Free (as in
Freedom!) Ableton Live Instuments from the super high-quality
`Philharmonia
Orchestra <http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music/>`__
samples.

Installation
============

ADGMaker requires that you have Python, OSX, and Ableton Live installed
already. Then, simply:

::

    $ pip install adgmaker

Automatic Usage
===============

The simplest way to use ADGMaker is with the '--all' and '--install'
arguments, which will fetch the instrument archives from the internet,
create ADGs, and install them into your Ableton installation
automatically:

::

    $ adgmaker --all --install

Then go to File -> Manage Files -> Manage User Library and use your new
instruments! You'll see them under the "Drums" tab. Tada!

Manual Usage
============

Download an instrument from `the Philharmonia Orchestra
website <http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/explore/make_music/double_bass>`__
and unzip it.

Then, (from a virtualenv), run:

::

    python adgmaker.py double_bass/

Then copy all of the .adg files to:

::

     ~/Music/Ableton/User\ Library/Presets/Instruments/Drum\ Rack/ 

(or wherever your Ableton is installed).

Then copy all of the mp3s to:

::

    ~/Music/Ableton/User\ Library/Samples/Imported

Then go to File -> Manage Files -> Manage User Library and use your new
instruments!

Caveats
=======

Some of the ADGs only have a few items in them, but most instruments
have at least a few ADG files that have a couple of complete scales. All
of the percussion instruments have been combined into a single
percussion ADG.

Some of the samples have a slight delay, so you might have to manually
set the sample start time to your liking. I also like to add a little
bit of fade out, reverb, and put them all into the same choke group,
depending on the sound I want.

TODO
====

-  Support other sound archives?
-  Support making multi-instrument racks?
-  Tests / CI!

Enjoy!

        Installation
        ------------
        You may install openwsn-coap with the standard pip command line, as shown
        below. See the pip `installation instructions`_ if it is not installed 
        already. You must be logged in with Windows administrator or Linux superuser
        privileges to install to system-level directories.
        
        ::
        
            > pip install openwsn-coap
            
        Alternatively, you may download the openwsn-coap archive, extract it, and
        install with the standard Python setup.py command line, as shown below. This
        command uses pip to retrieve other required Python libraries.
        
        ::
        
            > python setup.py install

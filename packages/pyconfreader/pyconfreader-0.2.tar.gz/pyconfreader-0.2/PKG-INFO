        Overview
        ========
        
        A library for reading config files written in Python. Since Python
        config files are not sandboxed, you should only read config files that
        you trust.
        
        By controlling the globals, locals, and builtins that are passed in to
        tthe config file, you can 'pre-populate' the config file with values,
        and you can control (to a very limited extent) what Python features
        are available to the config file.
        
        Two interfaces are provided:
        
        * A low-level interface for that takes strings.
        
        * A high-level interfaces that supports nested configuration files.
        
        Typical usage

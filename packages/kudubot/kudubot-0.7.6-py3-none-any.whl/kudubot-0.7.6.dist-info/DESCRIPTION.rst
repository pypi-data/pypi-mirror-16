Kudubot
=======

Kudubot is a bot framework that allows running a bot on a multitude of
messaging services. It is completely modular, adding new bot services
and new connection types is relatively trivial.

The framework offers abstractions that allow all properly implemented
bot services to work with different types of connections (Email,
Telegram, Whatsapp or IRC for example) without having to change the
code.

Installation
------------

To install the program, either run

::

    sudo pip install kudubot

or download the sources and run

::

    sudo python setup.py install

Setuptools should automatically download all required dependencies
without further input.

The program is being developed on Linux, it should in theory work on
Windows and Mac OS X, though this has not been tested.

**WARNING** To use the Whatsapp connection, you need to have Yowsup
installed. However, the current master branch of the original project
contains a bug that breaks things when receiving private messages.

To circumvent this, please install `my
fork <https://github.com/namboy94/yowsup>`__ of the project in the
meantime.

Usage
-----

You can start the bot using the 'kudubot' command (setuptools should
have installed it for you).

You will need to specify a connection type, which is the identifier
string for one of the implemented connections or 'all', which starts the
bot using all services.

You can also specify the output verbosity using the --verbosity. 0
disables all input, and there's no real upper limit (Though to keep it
sane, the highest verbosity that actually changes things is 5)

You can also directly run the bot without setting options by using one
of these commands (again, they should be installed by setuptools
automatically)

::

    kudubot-email     # For the email connection
    kudubot-telegram  # For the Telegram Connection
    kudubot-whatsapp  # For the Whatsapp Connection  (Doesn't work right now)
    kudubot-all       # For all connections

After starting the program for the first time, you will be notified that
config files were created. The program creates a directory called
'.kudubot' (which is a hidden directory on Linux). it contains all
configs, logs and other files/directories used by the bot services.

To be able to connect to a service, you will have to enter login
credentials into the config file of the chosen connection type, which
will be located under

::

    ~/.kudubot/config

The credential types are different for all types of connections and need
to be set accordingly. The program creates template files when first
run, so figuring out which kind of information to enter should not be
all that difficult.

Once the credentials are entered, you can adjust which services will be
run on startup by editing the -services file in the same directory.

As a last step you may want to adjust the admin and blacklist files in
the

::

    ~/.kudubot/contacts

directory to give yourself admin rights for the bot and ignore things
like other bots.

Developing
----------

If you are not viewing this on gitlab.namibsun.net, this is only a
mirror of that repository, active development is only being done on
gitlab.namibsun.net. Issues are being checked on all mirrors though, so
feel free to open issues on your version control hoster of choice.

For a guide on how to extend the bot, see
`this <doc/hand_crafted/extending_guide.md>`__.

Contributing
------------

This project is automatically mirrored to
`github <https://github.com/namboy94/kudubot>`__, however all
development is conducted at a privately hosted `Gitlab
instance <http://gitlab.namibsun.net/namboy94/kudubot>`__. Issues on
both services are taken unto consideration.

Description: Obol: useradd for ldap.
        =======================
        
        Obol is a command line utility to add, delete and modify users and
        groups in an LDAP server.
        
        Perhaps the most common use of LDAP is as a centralised store for
        usernames and passwords. The protocol for managing an LDAP server is
        somewhat verbose. It is cumbersome to create an LDIF file to modify a
        user attribute.
        
        For UNIX passwords, user and group management can be done using simple
        command line tools like useradd and groupadd. Obol was created to
        provide a similar interface, but to manage users and groups inside an
        LDAP server.

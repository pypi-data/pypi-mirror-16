Description: Uses cffi to build a simple interface for calling functions in a C file. This
        package is designed for convenience and should work only in the very simple
        cases. It is used in an educational setting in a mixed Python/C programming
        course.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        It is very simple. Say you have a "libfuncs.c" in the working directory
        
        .. code-block::c
            #include<stdio.h>
        
            int double(int x) {
                return x + x;
            }
        
        We can call the `double` function by relying in the implicit import in the
        :mod:`ccall` module.
        
        >>> import ccall as c
        >>> c.libfuncs.double(21)

    AMPD worker.

    Created by a worker function, namely, a python generator decorated by @worker:

       @worker
       def worker_example(arg1, ...):
           ...
           reply = yield request1(a, b)
           ...
           reply = yield request2()
           ...

    The first argument for the worker function (self, if a method) must be one of:

    a. A Client.
    b. A WorkerGroup.
    c. An object with a WorkerGroup attribute named 'ampd_worker_group'.

    The function returns a new Worker immediately.
    Its code is later executed by the main loop.
    A statement of the form:

        reply = yield request

    suspends execution until something happens and a reply is available.
    The request can be:

    a. An MPD command (other than 'idle' and 'noidle').
       Returns when the server's reply arrives:

           yield play(5)
           reply = yield status()

    b. A command list, returns a list of replies:

           yield command_list(command, ... | iterable)

    c. A passive request, emulating MPD's 'idle' command, with some improvements.
       Returns as soon as one of the conditions is satisfied, with a list of the satisfied conditions:

           reply = yield condition, ... | iterable

       Conditions can be:

       - A SUBSYSTEM name (in uppercase) or ANY to match any subsystem.
       - TIMEOUT(ms) - satisfied after 'ms' milliseconds.
       - CONNECT - client is connected to server.
       - IDLE - client is idle.
       - WORKER(worker, ... | iterable) - all workers are done.

    d. Special request:

           yield _self()

       Returns the executing Worker.

    e. A request list.
       Requests need not be commands.
       Can be slow.

           yield request, ... | iterable

    For MPD commands and subsystems see http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/command_reference.html

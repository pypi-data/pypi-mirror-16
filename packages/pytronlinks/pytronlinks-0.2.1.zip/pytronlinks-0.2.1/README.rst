    install LINKS   ( http://mega-voice-command.com/ )


Example
=======

.. code-block:: python

    import pytronlinks

    ai = pytronlinks.Client()

      """
      Optional client parameters-

        port: Port that links is listening on
        key: Links web key
        ip: ip of computer with links
        path: If you installed links in a different location,
                     point this to the Scripts folder( MUST BE RAW ) ie: (r'PATH')

      ex: ai = pytronlinks.Client(path='C:\\temp', ip='192.0.0.16', key='KEY123')
      """


Make Links speak!
=================

.. code-block:: python

    import pytronlinks

    PATH = (r'C:\users\default\AppData\Roaming\LINKS\Customization\Scripts')
    TEXT = ('MVC Rocks!')

    ai = pytronlinks.Client(PATH)
    ai.talk(TEXT)


Emulate speech to Links
=======================

.. code-block:: python

    import pytronlinks

    PATH = (r'C:\users\default\AppData\Roaming\LINKS\Customization\Scripts')
    TEXT = ('what is the weather like')

    ai = pytronlinks.Client(PATH)
    ai.emulate_speech(TEXT)

        Will call the command as if you had spoken to links directly


Run custom action command
=========================

 Anything you can put in Links *Action* bar, you can put in here! See example.

.. code-block:: python

    import pytronlinks


    ai = pytronlinks.Client()

    ai.custom(r'[Set("Last Subject", "pytron is the coolest")]')
    ai.custom(r'[Speak("[Get("Last Subject")]")]')


Put script into listen mode
===========================

.. code-block:: python

    import pytronlinks
    """
        To get dictation from Links into the dictation.txt file for pytron
        to do something with, make a command in Links like this -

          Command: pytron {speech=test_dictation}
          Response:
          Action: CMD /m /c "echo {speech} > \dictation.txt"
    """

    PATH = (r'C:\users\default\AppData\Roaming\LINKS\Customization\Scripts')
    ai = pytronlinks.Client(PATH)

    def main():
        dictation = listen()
        if x:
            ( do something with dictation )
            return

    try:
        while True:
            main()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass


Loquendo Function
=================

Sends a 'Loquendo by Nuance' speech command ( requires Nuance Loquendo voices )

        :param text: Text to be spoken ( with all the syntax they use, better make it raw, ie: r'text' )
        :param volume: Volume 0 - 100
        :param rate: Unsure of rate   ( needs testing )
        :param ai_name: Name of tts Voice ( case sensitive )

  Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytronlinks

    ai = pytronlinks.Client()
    ai.LoqSpeak("I am an example","100","50","Simon")]

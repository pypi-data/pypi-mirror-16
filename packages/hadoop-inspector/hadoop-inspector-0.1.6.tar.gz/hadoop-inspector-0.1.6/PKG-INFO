        Background
        ----------
        
        Data quality problems have plagued analytical systems for twenty years:
        continually appearing in the top four reasons for project failure.
        
        In this space data quality problems loom large - a small defect that
        could be safely ignored or forgotten in the transactional world hamper
        queries and cause users to question our credibility for months.
        
        The advent and innovation in Big Data and Data Science has not
        diminished this challenge. On Hadoop specifically: \* Data generally
        lacks any enforced constraints to ensure data validity \* Data is being
        added faster than ever, with less time to research upstream and ETL
        pipeline issues \* We are building vast systems, sometimes with hundreds
        of thousands of tasks being defined \* We often have democratized access
        to our clusters - with dozens of different people adding data.
        
        Additionally, in these large clusters most teams struggle to comply with
        policies and other requirements, whether regulatory, corporate or
        defined by their own teams. These might define general data retention
        requirements, or specific requirements for individual tables. They might
        define table naming conventions, security requirements, or stats aging &
        collection requirements.
        
        Objective
        ---------
        
        Hadoop-Inspector was built to address the needs to manage data quality
        within large, complex, and constantly loaded clusters that were
        unfulfilled by simple QA testing during development. It offers a
        solution more like an automobile assembly line: continuous quality
        control (QC) that can account for changes to upstream systems,
        accidental changes to production, data migration errors, and ETL/Ingest
        defects.
        
        Current Status
        --------------
        
        The software consists primarily of three parts:
        
        -  hadoopinspector-runner.py - a test-runner that writes results to a
           SQLite database and can produce a report of test results. This is the
           primary and most updated component at this time.
        -  hapinsp\_httpserver.py - serves the UI.
        -  hadoopinspector-demogen.py - which can generate 50,000+ check results
           against a hypothetical user hadoop environment. This is used to
           exercise the UI.

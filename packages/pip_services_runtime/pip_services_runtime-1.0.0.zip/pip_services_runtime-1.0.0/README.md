# <img src="https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services/raw/master/design/Logo.png" alt="Pip.Services Logo" style="max-width:30%"> <br/> Microservices runtime for Python

This framework is a part of [Pip.Services](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services) project.
It provides foundation for **composable microservices** using Python technology stack.
Each microservice is constructed from components created following 
[user-defined configuration](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services/blob/master/usage/Configuration.md). 

The current implementation is **experimental** and not ready for production. Pip.Services team welcomes interested
individuals and groups to bring it to ready state.

The conceptual architecture of the framework is presented on the diagram below. For more details , please, refer to 
[Pip.Services Reference Architecture](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services/blob/master/design/Architecture.md) document.

The main goal of the framework is to enable flexible microservice structure that can adjust based on the
user requirements. It allows to run microservices on virtually any platform, with any infrastructural services and storages
while protecting core business logic from rework due to changes in technologies and deployment configurations.

All functionality of the runtime is split into several packages:

The initial implementation is done by **Sergey Seroukhov**. Pip.Services team is looking for volunteers to 
take ownership over Python implementation in the project.

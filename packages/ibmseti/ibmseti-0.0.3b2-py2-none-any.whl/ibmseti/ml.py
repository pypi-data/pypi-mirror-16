def buildkNNModel(featuresList, classification):
  '''
  Perhaps we'd add a simple kNN model as an example for citizen scientists to follow.

  featuresList: list of features (which is also a list) 
                that have been extracted from spectrograms. 

  classification: a list of classifications, one for each of the set of features.

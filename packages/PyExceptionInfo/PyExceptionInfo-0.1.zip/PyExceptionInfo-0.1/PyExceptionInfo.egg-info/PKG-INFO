Description: PyExceptionInfo: Easily lookup your errors on the web
        =====================================================
        
        # Exceptions happen
        
        Exceptions do happen and we all have seen it more than once while we are
        developing our code. Mostly we would want to know more about the exception or
        error that we generated and the logical step that follows up is to inspect our
        code and still if we are stuck, we might lookup on the internet.
        
        PyExceptionInfo helps you on the last part. Use it in your exception handling,
        and it will automatically lookup the exception on Google for you.
        
        ## Example
        
        Look up the test.py source code for usage
        
            import PyExceptionInfo
        
            try:
                # Some exception here
            except Exception as e:
                PyExceptionInfo.getInfo(e)

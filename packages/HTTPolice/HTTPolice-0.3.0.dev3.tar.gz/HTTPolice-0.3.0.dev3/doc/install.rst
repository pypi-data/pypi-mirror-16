Installation
============

.. highlight:: console

HTTPolice is a Python package that requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+.
It can be installed like all other Python packages:
with `pip`__ from `PyPI`__.

__ https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
__ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/HTTPolice

If youâ€™re not familiar with pip,
you may need to install it `manually`__ or `from your OS distribution`__.
You may also need development files and tools for `lxml`__ dependencies.

__ https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/install_requirements_linux/
__ http://lxml.de/installation.html

`PyPy`__ (the 2.7 variant) is also supported,
but you may experience problems with older PyPy versions (5.3.1 should be OK).

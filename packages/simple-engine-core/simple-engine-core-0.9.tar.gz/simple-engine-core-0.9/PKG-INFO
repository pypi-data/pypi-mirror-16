        `simple-engine` reads in an html file and generates a JSON map corresponding to the html.
        
        ## installation
        
        `$ pip install simple-engine-core`
        
        ## usage
        
        put a `engine.json` file in a place that makes it convenient to type the source and destination paths out (a root
        directory will do)
        
        ex. `engine.json`
        
            {
                "src": "app/index.html",
                "dest": "output.js",
                "toplevelid": "start"
            }
        
        then run `engine` from the command line.

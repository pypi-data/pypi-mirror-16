Silent Dune Server

Description
===========

The Silent Dune Security Suite allows administrators the ability to intuitively 
manage and audit incoming and outgoing connections from any machine.  The SD suite 
is built on well known Open Source components.  The core principal of the Silent 
Dune Security suite is that machines should only talk to other machines that are 
trusted and should alert administrators when a connection is attempted to an 
unauthorized machine.

The goal of the Silent Dune Security suite is to make managing inbound/outbound firewall
rules and auditing easy and intuitive to administrators.

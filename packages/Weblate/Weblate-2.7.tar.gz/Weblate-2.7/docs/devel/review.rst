Reviewing source strings
========================

.. _reports:

Activity reports
----------------

You can check activity reports for translations, project or individual users.

Source strings checks
---------------------

Weblate includes quite a lot of :ref:`checks`. Some of them also focus on
quality of source strings. These can give you some hints for making strings
easier to translate. You can check failing source checks on :guilabel:`Source`
tab of every component.

Failing checks on translation
-----------------------------

On the other side, failing translation checks might also indicate problem in
the source strings. Translators often tend to fix some mistakes in translation
instead of reporting it - typical example is missing full stop at the end of
sentence, but there are more such cases.

Reviewing all failing checks on your translation can bring you valuable
feedback for improving source strings as well.

String comments
---------------

Weblate allows translators to comment on both translation and source strings.
Each :ref:`component` can be configured to receive such comments on email
address and sending this to developers mailing list is usually best approach.
This way you can monitor when translators find problems and fix them quickly.

CCH - Cloud CLI for Humans.

Very simple cloud CLI, specifically designed for human interaction.

Just type `mkvm` and it will help you step-by-step create a virtual machine, by
first providing a flavor, then a security group, and then root volume storage.
All the other commands are just as simple!


Installation
------------

    pip install cch

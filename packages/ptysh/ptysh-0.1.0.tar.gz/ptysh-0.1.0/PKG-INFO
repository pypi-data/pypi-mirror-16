Description: ## PTYSH
        PTYSH is an abbreviation of 'Python Teletype Shell'.<br>
        It was made with reference to the 'zebra vtysh'.<br>
        Vtysh is an integrated shell for Quagga routing software.<br>
        <br>
        Ptysh is not the only route shell, the shell is customizable, so you can normally use.<br>
        It made it possible to add commands to the module for availability.<br>
        
        
        ## Note
        You can install ptysh through the pip.<br>
        However, you must manually install some libraries.<br>
        I'll update the library list soon.<br>
        
        
        ## Usage
        ### Start shell
        When you run the 'ptysh_main.py', the shell begins.<br>
        You can use the commands summarized below.<br>
        During PTYSH to use commands such as ctrl-c and ctrl-z does not work.<br>
        
        
        ### Add custom module
        To add a module, you will create a file with reference to the sample code in the "modules" directory.<br>
        You can create additional logic inherit the class ptysh_module.<br>

Description: 
            LordKey
        
            It solves the problem of determining the combination in a sequence based on
            the some alphabet with a given length, and use combination to determine the
            iteration index.
        
        
            The problem.
        
            There are several elements to iterate - a, b and c. How many possible
            combinations for unique enumeration if key size is 3? Or which combination
            is at the tenth iteration? Or which iteration corresponds the `acc`
            combination?
        
            For `abc` alphabet and 3 key size can be created the next iterations:
        
                 0. aaa      1. aab      2. aac      3. aba      4. abb      5. abc
                 6. aca      7. acb      8. acc      9. baa     10. bab     11. bac
                12. bba     13. bbb     14. bbc     15. bca     16. bcb     17. bcc
                18. caa     19. cab     20. cac     21. cba     22. cbb     23. cbc
                24. cca     25. ccb     26. ccc
        
            So, the maximum number of iterations - 27, for 10 iteration corresponds to
            `baa` combination and the `acc` combination - it is 7 iteration.

    :rtype: tuple

.. function:: cwave.read_audio_data(audio_file_path, from_sample, num_samples)

    Read audio samples from the given WAVE mono file.

    The returned tuple ``(sr, data)`` contains
    the sample rate of the WAVE file,
    and the samples read as a NumPy 1D array
    of ``float64`` values in ``[-1.0, 1.0]``.

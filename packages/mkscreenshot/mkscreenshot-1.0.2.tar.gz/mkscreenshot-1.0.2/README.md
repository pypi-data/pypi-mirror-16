`mkscreenshot` takes screenshots of websites from the command line using selenium and PhantomJS.


## Installation

First, you need to install PhantomJS and ensure it's on your path.

You can do this by manually [downloading PhantomJS](phantom) from their website (all platforms); installing PhantomJS with Homebrew: `brew cask install phantomjs` (OS X); installing PhantomJS with npm: `npm install -g phantomjs` (all platforms); or using your system's package manager.

That's the hard part! Once that's done, installing `mkscreenshot` is as simple as:

```
pip3 install mkscreenshot
```

_Please note: `mkscreenshot` is only tested with Python 3.5 â€“ you should be using Python 3!_


## Usage

```
Usage: mkscreenshot [OPTIONS] URL

Options:
  --output TEXT    Filename for the screenshot (defaults to the domain name)
  --sleep INTEGER  Wait before taking the screenshot to allow asynchronous
                   scripts to load
  --width INTEGER  Specify the width of the browser window
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```


For example, to take a screenshot of the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) homepage:

```
> mkscreenshot https://news.ycombinator.com
```

And you'll get a screenshot like this:

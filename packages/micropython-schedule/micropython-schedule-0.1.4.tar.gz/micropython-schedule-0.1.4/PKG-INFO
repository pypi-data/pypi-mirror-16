        History
        -------
        
        0.3.2 (2015-07-02)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed issues where scheduling a job with a functools.partial as the job function fails. Thanks @dylwhich.
        - Fixed an issue where scheduling a job to run every >= 2 days would cause the initial execution to happen one day early. Thanks @WoLfulus for identifying this and providing a fix.
        - Added a FAQ item to describe how to schedule a job that runs only once.
        
        0.3.1 (2014-09-03)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed an issue with unicode handling in setup.py that was causing trouble on Python 3 and Debian (https://github.com/dbader/schedule/issues/27). Thanks to @waghanza for reporting it.
        - Added an FAQ item to describe how to deal with job functions that throw exceptions. Thanks @mplewis.
        
        0.3.0 (2014-06-14)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added support for scheduling jobs on specific weekdays. Example: ``schedule.every().tuesday.do(job)`` or ``schedule.every().wednesday.at("13:15").do(job)`` (Thanks @abultman.)
        - Run tests against Python 2.7 and 3.4. Python 3.3 should continue to work but we're not actively testing it on CI anymore.
        
        0.2.1 (2013-11-20)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed history (no code changes).
        
        0.2.0 (2013-11-09)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - This release introduces two new features in a backwards compatible way:
        - Allow jobs to cancel repeated execution: Jobs can be cancelled by calling ``schedule.cancel_job()`` or by returning ``schedule.CancelJob`` from the job function. (Thanks to @cfrco and @matrixise.)
        - Updated ``at_time()`` to allow running jobs at a particular time every hour. Example: ``every().hour.at(':15').do(job)`` will run ``job`` 15 minutes after every full hour. (Thanks @mattss.)
        - Refactored unit tests to mock ``datetime`` in a cleaner way. (Thanks @matts.)
        
        0.1.11 (2013-07-30)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed an issue with ``next_run()`` throwing a ``ValueError`` exception when the job queue is empty. Thanks to @dpagano for pointing this out and thanks to @mrhwick for quickly providing a fix.
        
        0.1.10 (2013-06-07)
        +++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Fixed issue with ``at_time`` jobs not running on the same day the job is created (Thanks to @mattss)
        
        0.1.9 (2013-05-27)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Added ``schedule.next_run()``
        - Added ``schedule.idle_seconds()``
        - Args passed into ``do()`` are forwarded to the job function at call time
        - Increased test coverage to 100%
        
        
        0.1.8 (2013-05-21)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - Changed default ``delay_seconds`` for ``schedule.run_all()`` to 0 (from 60)
        - Increased test coverage
        
        0.1.7 (2013-05-20)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - API change: renamed ``schedule.run_all_jobs()`` to ``schedule.run_all()``
        - API change: renamed ``schedule.run_pending_jobs()`` to ``schedule.run_pending()``
        - API change: renamed ``schedule.clear_all_jobs()`` to ``schedule.clear()``
        - Added ``schedule.jobs``
        
        0.1.6 (2013-05-20)
        ++++++++++++++++++

        0.1.4 (2013-05-20)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - API change: renamed ``schedule.tick()`` to ``schedule.run_pending_jobs()``
        - Updated README and ``setup.py`` packaging
        
        0.1.0 (2013-05-19)
        ++++++++++++++++++

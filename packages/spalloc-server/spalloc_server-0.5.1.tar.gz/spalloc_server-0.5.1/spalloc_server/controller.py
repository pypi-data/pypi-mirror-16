class Controller(object):
    """An object which allocates jobs to machines and manages said machines'
    hardware.

    This object is intended to form the core of a server which manages the
    queueing and execution of jobs on several SpiNNaker machines at once using
    a :py:class:`~spalloc_server.job_queue.JobQueue` and interacts with
    the hardware of said machines using
    :py:class:`~spalloc_server.async_bmp_controller.AsyncBMPController`.

    'Jobs' may be created using the :py:meth:`.create_job` and are allocated a
    unique ID. Jobs are then queued, allocated and destroyed according to
    machine availability and user intervention. The state of a job may be
    queried using methods such as :py:meth:`.get_job_state`. When a job changes
    state it is added to the :py:attr:`.changed_jobs` set. If a job's state is
    changed due to a background process (rather than in response to calling a
    :py:class:`.Controller` method), :py:attr:`.on_background_state_change` is
    called.

    :py:class:`~spalloc_server.job_queue.JobQueue` calls callbacks in
    this object when queued jobs are allocated to machines
    (:py:meth:`._job_queue_on_allocate`), allocations are freed
    (:py:meth:`._job_queue_on_free`) or cancelled without being allocated
    (:py:meth:`._job_queue_on_cancel`). These callback functions implement the
    bulk of the functionality of this object by recording state changes in
    jobs and triggering the sending of power/link commands to SpiNNaker
    machines.

    Machines may be added, modified and removed at any time by modifying the
    :py:attr:`.machines` attribute. If a machine is removed or changes
    significantly, jobs running on the machine are cancelled, otherwise
    existing jobs should continue to execute or be scheduled on any new
    machines as appropriate.

    Finally, once the controller is shut down (and outstanding BMP commands are
    flushed) using :py:meth:`.stop` and :py:meth:`.join` methods, it may be
    :py:mod:`pickled <pickle>` and later unpickled to resume operation of the
    controller from where it left off before it was shut down.

    Users should, at a regular interval call :py:meth:`.destroy_timed_out_jobs`
    in order to destroy any queued or running jobs which have not been kept
    alive recently enough.

    Unless otherwise indicated, all methods are thread safe.

    Attributes
    ----------
    max_retired_jobs : int
        Maximum number of retired jobs to retain the state of.
    machines : {name: \
            :py:class:`~spalloc_server.configuration.Machine`, ...} \
            or similar OrderedDict
        Defines the machines now available to the controller.
    changed_jobs : set([job_id, ...])
        The set of job_ids whose state has changed since the last time this set
        was accessed. Reading this value clears it.
    changed_machines : set([machine_name, ...])
        The set of machine names whose state has changed since the last time
        this set was accessed. Reading this value clears it. For example,
        machines are marked as changed if their tags are changed, if they are
        added or removed or if a job is allocated or freed on them.
    on_background_state_change : function() or None
        A function which is called (from any thread) when any state changes
        occur in a background process and not as a direct result of calling a
        method of the controller.

        The callback function *must not* call any methods of the controller
        object.

        Note that this attribute is not pickled and unpicking a controller sets
        this attribute to None.

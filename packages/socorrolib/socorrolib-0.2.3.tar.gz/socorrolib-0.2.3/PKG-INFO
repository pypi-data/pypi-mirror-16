        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/socorrolib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/socorrolib)
        
        The common library of the socorro crash reporter system.
        
        Factoring out the common library is the first step to breaking up the mozilla/socorro monorepo, which contains multiple services as a historic quirk of Mozilla's development and deployment process.
        
        Currently socorrolib is pinned to socorro revision:
        1c485ce3e6e6b2839834ad8a9f184e407dc8c825
        
        Eventually this relationship will invert and socorro should use standard import tools to pin a version of socorrolib.
        
        ## running tests
        
        ```
        pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
        
        # all them tests
        nosetests socorrolib
        
        # with coverage
        nosetests socorrolib --with-coverage --cover-html --cover-package=socorrolib
        
        # to run a specific test
        nostests socorrolib.unittest.external.test_crashstorage_base:TestCase.TestBase
        ```
        
        ## making a release
        
        Travis-CI ships releases to pypi whenever a tag is pushed. You'll want to bump the version number in `setup.py` before you try that.

This is a toolbox that can be used to plot and analyze mechanical properties of materials.

To better get a sense of how this can help you, check out the docs.
Get started with **index.html** in the html folder.

To my understanding, there are no tools currently available to automatically determine the yield stress of a material. 
This is a huge drawback for large datasets, and so the **yield_stress()** function seeks to create a universal tool to do so, using regression analysis.

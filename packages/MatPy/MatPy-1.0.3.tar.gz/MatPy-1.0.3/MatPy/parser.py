Stress-Strain Data Parser
*************************

Given a file containing experimental stress-strain
data, this class parses it and turns it into a
numpy array.

If the data is in a text file, it just needs
to be two columns, the first one strain, and
the second one stress.

If the data is in an XML file, it should have
a stressStrain tag where the relevant data begins
and then rows and columns with data as follows::

    <headers>
	<column id="1">True Strain</column>
	<column id="2">True Stress [MPa]</column>
	<column id="3">True Strain Rate [1/s]</column>
    </headers>
    <rows>
	<row id="1">
	    <column id="1">0.000303349228225</column>
	    <column id="2">-10.3437455647</column>
	    <column id="3">0.0</column>
	</row>
	<row id="2">
	    <column id="1">4.86122562637e-06</column>
	    <column id="2">9.89667339963</column>
	    <column id="3">-596.976005197</column>
	</row>
    </rows>

Description: This is a toolbox that can be used to plot and analyze mechanical properties of materials.

        To my understanding, there are no tools currently available to automatically determine the yield stress of a material. 
        This is a huge drawback for large datasets, and so the **yield_stress()** function seeks to create a universal tool to do so, using regression analysis.

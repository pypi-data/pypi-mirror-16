===========  ==================================

This is an efficient Python/Cython implementation of the semiparametric
`XL-mHG test`__ for enrichment in ranked lists. The XL-mHG test is an extension
of the nonparametric `mHG test`__, which was developed by `Dr. Zohar
Yakhini`__ and colleagues.

Comput Biol, 2007)`__ and `Wagner (PeerJ Preprints, 2016)`__.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xlmhg

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import xlmhg
    stat, cutoff, pval = xlmhg.xlmhg_test(v, X, L)

Where ``v`` is a NumPy array of type \"np.uint8\" containing only zeros and ones, ``X``, and ``L`` are parameters, and the return values have the following meanings:

- ``stat``: The XL-mHG test statistic
- ``cutoff``: The cutoff at which the XL-mHG test statistic was attained
- ``pval``: The XL-mHG p-value

What do the ``X`` and ``L`` parameters mean?
--------------------------------------------

- ``X`` refers to the minimum number of "1's" that have to be seen before anything can be called "enrichment".
- ``L`` is the lowest cutoff (i.e., the largest ``n``) that is being tested for enrichment.

A more direct way to understand ``X`` and ``L`` is through the definition of the XL-mHG test statistic. It is defined as the minimum hypergeometric p-value over all cutoffs at which at least ``X`` "1's" have already been seen, and which are at or below the n'th cutoff. All other cutoffs are ignored. For `X=1` and `L=N`, no relevant cutoffs are ignored, and the XL-mHG test reduces to the mHG test.

Background
----------

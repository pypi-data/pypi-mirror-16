===========  =====================================================

This is an efficient Python/Cython implementation of the semiparametric
`XL-mHG test`__ for enrichment in ranked lists. The XL-mHG test is an extension
of the nonparametric `mHG test`__, which was developed by `Dr. Zohar
Yakhini`__ and colleagues.

Comput Biol, 2007)`__ and `Wagner (PLoS One, 2015)`__.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xlmhg

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import xlmhg
    stat, cutoff, pval = xlmhg.xlmhg_test(v, X, L)

Where: ``v`` is the ranked list of 0's and 1's, represented by a NumPy array of
type \"np.uint8\", `X`` and ``L`` are parameters, and the return values have
the following meanings:

- ``stat``: The XL-mHG test statistic
- ``cutoff``: The cutoff at which the XL-mHG test statistic was attained
- ``pval``: The XL-mHG p-value

What do the ``X`` and ``L`` parameters mean?
--------------------------------------------

- ``X`` refers to the minimum number of "1's" that have to be seen before
  anything can be called "enrichment".
- ``L`` is the lowest cutoff (i.e., the largest ``n``) that is being tested
  for enrichment.

A more direct way to understand ``X`` and ``L`` is through the definition of
the XL-mHG test statistic. It is defined as the minimum hypergeometric p-value
over all cutoffs at which at least ``X`` "1's" have already been seen, and
excluding any cutoffs larger than ``L``. For `X=1` and `L=N`, the XL-mHG test
reduces to the mHG test.

Background
----------

For a discussion of the statistical background and implementation of this test,
please see the `Technical Report on arXiv <http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07905>`_,
as well as the `XL-mHG PeerJ Preprint article`__.

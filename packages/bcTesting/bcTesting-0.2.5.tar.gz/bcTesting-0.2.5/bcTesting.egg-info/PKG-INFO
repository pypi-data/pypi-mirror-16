        Installation
        ============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        * ``bcTesting`` was tested only on Python 2.7, on both Linux and Windows. It should work on any later version as well.
        
        Installation process
        --------------------
        
        Installing ``bcTesting`` is very simple. Once you download and unzip the package, you just have to execute the standard ``python setup.py install``. The setup script will then place the ``bcTesting`` module into ``site-packages`` in your Python's installation library.
        
        Alternatively, since ``bcTesting`` is listed in the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bcTesting>`_ (PyPI), you can install it using your favorite Python packaging/distribution tool, for example with::
        
            > pip install bcTesting
        
        It's recommended to run ``_build_tables.py`` in the ``bcTesting`` code directory after installation to make sure the parsing tables are pre-generated. This can make your code run faster.

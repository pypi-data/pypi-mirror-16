mlutils package is intended to be a collection of utilities for AI planning and not-supervised learning. 
Development is in progress.

Version history:

0.1.0
  -- N-Ary tree class supported various search algorithms: pre-order, post-order, breadth-first 
     heuristic (you should provide heuristic function) and random sampling. 
  -- State space generation/search.

0.2.0 
  -- Basic graph class. Implements generic directed graph.
  -- Finite automata graph. Implements discrete finite automata state machine on base of BasicGraph class.
  -- Processing graph. Implements network of asynchronius processing units, running in separate threads. 
     Intended to be used as complex pipeline (pipenet) for machne learning or data processing.

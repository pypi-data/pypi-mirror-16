Description: 
        mlutils package is collection of various utilities for machine learning and AI planning. 
          -- N-Ary tree class supported various search algorithms: pre-order, post-order, breadth-first 
             heuristic (you should provide heuristic function) and random sampling. 
          -- State space generation/search.
          -- Basic graph class. Implements generic directed graph.
          -- Finite automata graph. Implements discrete finite automata state machine on base of BasicGraph class.
          -- Processing graph. Implements network of asynchronius processing units, running in separate threads. 
             Intended to be used as complex pipeline (pipenet) for machne learning or data processing.
          
        Dependency:
           Package does not have extra dependencies except python standard library 
          
        Installation:
           Standard installation for pure python modules
           
        Usage examples:
           Each modute has test() function which implement brif self-testing and may serve as usage example

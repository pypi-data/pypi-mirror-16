        ISA (Independent Statistics Aggregator) collects node statistics for a cluster of nodes.
        
        ========
        Features
        ========
        
        - Can collect many node statistics such as CPU usage, memory usage and disk I/O
        - Easy to setup and flexible node configuration
        - Ensures minimal influence for the node statistics
        - No setup required on the nodes, the statistic management is done centrally

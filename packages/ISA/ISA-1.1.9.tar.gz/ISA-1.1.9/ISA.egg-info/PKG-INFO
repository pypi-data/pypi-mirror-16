        ISA (Independent Statistics Aggregator) collects node statistics for a cluster of nodes.
        
        ========
        Features
        ========
        
        - Can collect many node statistics such as CPU usage, memory usage and disk I/O
        - Easy to setup and flexible node configuration
        - Ensures minimal influence for the node statistics
        - No setup required on the nodes, the statistic management is done centrally
        
        ============
        Installation
        ============
        Run the following code in order to install ISA:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
           pip install isa
        
        Or you can install ISA using `setup.py`:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
           python setup.py install
        
        ==============
        Simple example
        ==============
        Suppose you have two servers. `server-a` with ip address `127.0.0.1`, username `root` and password `pass123` and you have a second server `server-b` with hostname `www.mydomain.com`, username `ubuntu` and password `test123`. This information needs to be specified in a `nodes.ini` file, so ISA can connect to your servers:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
           [server-a]
           host = 127.0.0.1
           username = root
           password = pass123
        
           [server-b]
           host = www.mydomain.com
           username = ubuntu
           password = test123
        
        Now we have this in place, we can use ISA to monitor the two nodes:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
           isa /path/to/nodes.ini
        
        If you want to write all results directly to a CSV file, you can use the following snippet:
        
        .. code-block:: text
        
           isa /path/to/nodes.ini --out stats.csv

jaraco.windows
==============

Status and License
------------------

``jaraco.windows`` aims to provide a pure-python interface to Windows
APIs using ctypes. This package is not designed to be exhaustive, but
rather to supply interfaces as they are needed by the contributors.

``jaraco.windows`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
`MIT-style permissive license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.util``, or from the
`mercurial repository
<http://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.windows/get/tip.zip#egg=jaraco.windows-dev>`_ with
``easy_install jaraco.windows==dev``.

Package Contents
----------------

``jaraco.windows`` contains several modules for different purposes. For now,
read the source. Eventually, I will put high-level descriptions of the modules
here.

Installation
------------

You should install this module the normal way using setuptools or distribute.

If you want to monkeypatch the os module to include symlink compatibility, you
should add the following to your ``usercustomize`` or ``sitecustomize`` module:

	``import jaraco.windows.filesystem as fs; fs.patch_os_module()``

Thereafter, you should be able to use ``os.symlink`` and ``os.readlink`` in Windows
Vista and later using the same interface as on Unix.

Note that ``jaraco.windows.filesystem.symlink`` takes an additional optional
parameter ``target_is_directory``, which must be specified if the target is not
present and is expected to be a directory once present.

Contribute
----------

If jaraco.windows doesn't supply the interface you require for your
application, consider creating the interface and providing a patch
to the author.

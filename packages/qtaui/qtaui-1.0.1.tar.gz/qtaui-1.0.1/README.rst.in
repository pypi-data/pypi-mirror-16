What is qtaui ?
-------------

qtaui is a minimalist clone of wxPython's `wxaui <https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/WxAUI>`_. It allows a PySide-based program to arrange "frames", i.e. child widgets, in an arbitrary tree of splitters and tabs. The user can "undock" a frame and let it float as a top-level window, or drop it back onto the UI in a position that will create a new splitter or tabbed interface, or add it to an existing one.

This code is licensed under the `GNU LGPL version 3 or, at your
option, any later version

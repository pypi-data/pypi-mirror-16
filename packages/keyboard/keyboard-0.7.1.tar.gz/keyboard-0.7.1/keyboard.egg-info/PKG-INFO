Description: keyboard
        ========
        
        Take full control of your keyboard with this small Python library. Hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.
        
        - Global event hook (captures keys regardless of focus).
        - Simulates key presses.
        - Complex hotkey support (e.g. `Ctrl+Shift+A` followed by `Alt+Space`) with controllable timeout.
        - Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with full internationalization support ('Ctrl+รง').
        - Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.
        - Pure Python, no C modules to be compiled.
        - Zero dependencies. Trivial to install and deploy.
        - Works with Windows and Linux (if you have a Mac, pull requests are welcome).
        - Python 2 and Python 3.
        - Tested and documented.
        - Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook)
        - Mouse support coming soon.
        
        Example:
        
        ```
        import keyboard
        
        # Press PAGE UP then PAGE DOWN to type "foobar".
        keyboard.add_hotkey('page up, page down', lambda: keyboard.write('foobar'))
        
        # Blocks until you press esc.
        wait('esc')
        ```
        
        This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers.

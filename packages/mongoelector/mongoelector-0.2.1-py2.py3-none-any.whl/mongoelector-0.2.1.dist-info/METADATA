.. NOTE::
   As of 0.2.0, the API for the distributed lock functionality is probably finalized.
   As for stability, I'm using this in several production projects and it's working well.
   I will be starting work on the elector portion of this project very soon, on separate
   branches, that feature will be pre-alpha for several releases.

## Bear Installation Tool

coala features a Bear Installation Tool that helps installing bears one by one
or all of them. This tool is helpful as it also manages to install the bears'
external dependencies.

## Installation

To install the tool, simply run:

    $ pip3 install coala-install

## Usage


To use the tool, run

    $ coala-install

and a question will pop-up. To install all the bears, simple type ``All``.
If you want just a few bears, type ``Some``. Then, a list with all the
bears, collected from PyPI, will pop up. You will now have to choose the bears
you want to install, separated by commas, and along with the dependencies,
the bears will install. To quit, simply type anything else.

The tool features syntax highlighting, which highlights the options that are
in the given lists, and also autocompletion.

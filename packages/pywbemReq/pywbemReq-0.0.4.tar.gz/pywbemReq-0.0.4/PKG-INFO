Description: PyWBEM Client
        =============
        
        The PyWBEM Client project provides a WBEM client library and some related
        utilities, written in pure Python.
        
        A WBEM client allows issuing operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM
        operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined in the DMTF standards
        DSP0200 and DSP0201. See http://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem for information
        about WBEM. This is used for all kinds of systems management tasks that are
        supported by the system running the WBEM server.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        For information on how to use the PyWBEM Client for your own development
        projects, or how to contribute to it, go to the
        `PyWBEM Client page`_.

        About this Fork for pywbem - pywbemReq
        ======================================
        
        A simplified wbem client.
        
        Remove mof compiler and twisted client.
        And remove the dependencies caused by them.
        
        Remove some xml validation.  Do not break the xml parsing/construction
        if request/response xml is not align with the schema.
         
        Introduce python 3 compatible code.  The wbem client should be working fine
        under python 3.
        
        Replace the m2crypto/httplib with requests_.

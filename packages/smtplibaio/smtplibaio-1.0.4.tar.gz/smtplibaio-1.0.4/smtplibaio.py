'''SMTP/ESMTP client class.

This should follow RFC 821 (SMTP), RFC 1869 (ESMTP), RFC 2554 (SMTP
Authentication) and RFC 2487 (Secure SMTP over TLS).

Notes:

Please remember, when doing ESMTP, that the names of the SMTP service
extensions are NOT the same thing as the option keywords for the RCPT
and MAIL commands!

Example:

@asyncio.coroutine
def send(from_email, to_email, msg)
    server = SMTP_SSL()
    code, msg = yield from server.connect(mail_server)
    assert code == 220, "connect failed"
    try:
        yield from server.login(mailbox_name, mailbox_password)
        yield from server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())
    finally:
        yield from server.quit()

        """ This is a subclass derived from SMTP that connects over an SSL
        encrypted socket (to use this class you need a socket module that was
        compiled with SSL support). If host is not specified, '' (the local
        host) is used. If port is omitted, the standard SMTP-over-SSL port
        (465) is used.  local_hostname and source_address have the same meaning
        as they do in the SMTP class.  keyfile and certfile are also optional -
        they can contain a PEM formatted private key and certificate chain file
        for the SSL connection. context also optional, can contain a
        SSLContext, and is an alternative to keyfile and certfile; If it is
        specified both keyfile and certfile must be None.

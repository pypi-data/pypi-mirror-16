# ricloud-py: iCloud access made easy

This is the sample Python client for Reincubate's [iCloud API](https://www.reincubate.com/labs/icloud-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud).

> Refer to the comprehensive [iCloud API documentation](https://www.reincubate.com/contact/support/icloud-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud) for a fuller picture of the API's capabilities, specifications, and benefits.

## Installation

The library can be installed with a single command:

```bash
$ pip install ricloud
```

### Configuration

The API relies on a set of security credentials, which are stored in an ``ricloud.ini`` file. This package ships with a default configuration file which enables limited access to the API for demonstration purposes.

The default credentials can be overridden by creating an override file named ``.ricloud.ini`` in the user's ``HOME`` directory. Alternately, a ``RICLOUD_CONF`` environment variable can be set, specifying the full path and filename of the configuration file.

This file should have the following details:

```yaml
[auth]
# Required and supplied by Reincubate
user =
key =

[test]
# If you want to run automated tests against your account, set these.
user =
key =
apple_id =
password =
```

## Usage

A sample script is included which provides an example of how the API can be used to access a range of datatypes in a way that is compatible with Apple's 2FA mechanism.

To run the sample script, execute the following command:

```bash
$ python -c "from ricloud.sample_script import main; main();"
```

A sample output of the sample script is provided.

### Authentication against the API and listing iCloud data

```python
from ricloud.api import RiCloud

api = RiCloud()

# Login to iCloud. If you have two factor authentication enabled then you'll need
# submit a challenge request and a response. Have a look at the sample_script.py
# file for an example of this.

api.login(APPLE_ID, APPLE_PASSWORD)

# Now we have a list of the devices connected to this account stored in `api.devices`
# Let's have a look:

print api.devices
```

That `api.devices` dictionary contains data in this format:

```python
{u'7c7fba66680ef796b916b067077cc246adacf01d': {
    u'colour': u'#e4e7e8',
    u'device_name': u"Renate's iPhone",
    u'latest-backup': u'2016-03-17 16:46:39.000000',
    u'model': u'N71mAP',
    u'name': u'iPhone 6s'},
 u'8e281be6657d4523710d96341b6f86ba89b56df7': {
    u'colour': u'#e1e4e3',
    u'device_name': u"Renate's iPad",
    u'latest-backup': u'2016-03-13 19:35:52.000000',
    u'model': u'J98aAP',
    u'name': u'iPad Pro'},
}
```

In the `api.devices` dictionary, the keys are device ids of the devices associated with the iCloud account.

### Using the JSON feed API

The API is able to retrieve data from a wide range of apps; a list is provided below.

> Functionality such as message undeletion can be enabled on demand against API keys.

To request a data type, users can pass a mask of data types to the `BackupClient.request_data` method. To select multiple data types, separate each type with the bitwise OR ``|`` operator. For example to select both SMS and photo data:

```python
# SMS and photo retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_SMS | BackupClient.DATA_PHOTOS
```

If no selection is made, the API will return all available data available.

The following is a complete list of the bit-flags that can be passed to `BackupClient.request_data`.

#### Device-specific iOS data

```python
# For Message (SMS, MMS, iMessage) retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_SMS

# For photo retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_PHOTOS

# For browser history retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_BROWSER_HISTORY

# For call history retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_CALL_HISTORY

# For list of installed apps
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_INSTALLED_APPS

# For device contact retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_CONTACTS

# For appointment retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_APPOINTMENTS

# For App usage retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_APP_USAGE

# For Notes retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_NOTES

# For list of files associated to a device
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_FILE_LIST

# For live Web browser history retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WEB_BROWSER_HISTORY
```

#### iCloud account-specific data

```python
# For iCloud contact retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WEB_CONTACTS

# For location retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WEB_LOCATION

# For list of all devices associated with an iCloud account
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WEB_ACCESS_DEVICES
```

#### App-specific data

```python
# For WhatsApp message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WHATSAPP_MESSAGES

# For WhatsApp call history retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WHATSAPP_CALL_HISTORY

# For Skype message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_SKYPE_MESSAGES

# For Facebook message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_FACEBOOK_MESSAGES

# For Snapchat message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_SNAPCHAT_MESSAGES

# For Viber message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_VIBER_MESSAGES

# For Viber call history
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_VIBER_CALL_HISTORY

# For Line message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_LINE_MESSAGES

# For Kik message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_KIK_MESSAGES

# For Wechat message retrieval
requested_data = BackupClient.DATA_WECHAT_MESSAGES
```

#### Simple sample script

We can combine the ideas above to write a simple script to access iCloud data via the JSON feed.

```python
from datetime import datetime
import json

from ricloud.api import RiCloud
from ricloud.backup import BackupClient

api = RiCloud()

# Login to iCloud. If you have two factor authentication enabled then you'll need
# submit a challenge request and a response. Have a look at the sample_script.py
# file for an example of this.
api.login(APPLE_ID, APPLE_PASSWORD)

# Now we have a list of the devices connected to this account stored in `api.devices`
# For this sample script, let's just look at the first device
device = api.devices.keys()[0]

# Build a bit mask of the data we want to access. If you don't set this then the
# API will supply all the information your account has access to.
data_types = BackupClient.DATA_SMS | BackupClient.DATA_INSTALLED_APPS

# Ask for any new data since the Jan 1st 2015. If you don't supply this, the API
# will return ALL data available.
since = datetime(2015, 1, 1)

# Fire the request
data = api.backup_client.request_data(device, data_mask=data_types, since=since)

# Print the output to console
print json.dumps(data, indent=2)

# Let's get any attachments which have been referenced by the messages
# The arguments for `download_file` are the `device_id` to download from
# and the `file_id`.
for sms in data['sms']:
    for attachment in sms['attachments']:
        with open(attachment['filename'], 'wb') as out:
            api.backup_client.download_file(device, attachment['file_id'], out)
```

### Using the raw file access API

The raw file access API is available for downloading message attachments, or
directly downloading more esoteric files from the iCloud.

> As noted above, it is invariably better to use the JSON feeds when working with app data. The JSON feeds provide faster and more accurate data access.

The `BackupClient.download_file` method takes a ``file_id``, ``device_id`` and a
file handle to write the file to. `file_id`s are built from SHA-1 hashes of a
file's AppDomain and filename.

```python
out = open(filename, 'wb')
api.backup_client.download_file(device_id, file_id, out)
```

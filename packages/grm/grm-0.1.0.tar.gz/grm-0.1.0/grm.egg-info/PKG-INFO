Description: GitRoom Manager  
        ===============
        
        GitRoom Manager allows instructors to more easily manage a
        GitHub-based virtual classroom. From within the program, the user can:
        
        - Initialize student repositories, locally and remotely, from a CSV
          roster and a local master repository
        - Add students to an existing course
        - Add administrators to the course (other instructors)
        - Update student repositories with new course content
        - Pull from/push to student repositories
        - Grade assignments
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 3.x
        - Ownership of a `GitHub Classroom`_
          
        .. _GitHub Classroom: https://classroom.github.com/  
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install the `grm` module, clone the repository to your local
        machine and `cd` into the top-level directory. From the terminal, type:
        
        .. code::
        
           python setup.py install
        
        
        *NOTE:* You may need to use `python3` or `python3.x` in place of
        `python` in order to utilize a Python 3 installation.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can call GitRoom Manager from within an interactive Python session by
        calling:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           import grm
           grm.main()
        
        the installation also adds an executable to your path. You can call
        GitRoom Manager from terminal using:

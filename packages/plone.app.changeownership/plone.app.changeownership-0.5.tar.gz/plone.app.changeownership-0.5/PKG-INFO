Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.app.changeownership as it sounds is a Plone package to change objects
        ownership.
        
        Problem
        =======
        
        While for a single content you can call the ``/ownership_form`` view,
        there is no way in Plone to transfer **ownership of all objects** owned by an user
        to a new user. To delete a Plone member in such case is not an option. 
        
        Solution
        ========
        
        plone.app.changeownership makes easy to transfer ownership from one ore more 
        members to a new member. It also can change content metadata, like *Creators*
        field.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        See docs/INSTALL.txt for a buildout configuration.
        
        You have to install the package from quickinstaller or setup_tool. You will get
        a configlet in the Plone control panel named "Change Ownership".

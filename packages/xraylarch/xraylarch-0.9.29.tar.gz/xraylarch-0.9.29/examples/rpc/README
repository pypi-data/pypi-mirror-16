This directory shows examples of using larch by Remote Procedure Call. 
This has severl important possible use cases:
 1. Larch can be run on a separate machine
 2. Multiple larch process can be running simultaneously, 
    and a client can switch between them.
 3. A client can exit, but the underlying larch process
    can be persistant, and so re-joined later.

To start a larch RPC server, use 
    larch -r

You can specify a port with 
    larch -r -p 4966

The examples here shows a simple client that simply runs some larch
commands and retrieves some data (which is transferred with json).

Description: 
        
        TRUESIGHT PULSE METER PLUGIN SDK FOR PYTHON
        
        
        This provides a framework for the development of the TrueSight Pulse
        Meter Plugins
        
        [Build Status]
        
        
        Measurement Transports
        
        The SDK supports sending measurements to Pulse via 3 different methods:
        
        -   Standard Out
        -   Meter RPC
        -   Measurement API
        
        Standard Out
        
        Plugin writes to standard out which is read by the Plugin Manager which
        then forwards to the meter via Meter RPC API, which then sends to Pulse.
        
        Meter RPC
        
        Plugin writes to Meter RPC channel which then sends to Pulse.
        
        Measurement API
        
        Plugin writes to Pulse Measurement REST API directly sending to Pulse
        
        
        DataSources
        
        The framework supports the following data sources, custom data sources
        can be created by extending the default data source

        -   Exec
        -   HTTP/HTTPS

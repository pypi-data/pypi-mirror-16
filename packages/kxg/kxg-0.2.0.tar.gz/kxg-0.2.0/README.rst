KXG Game Engine
===============
This library provides a framework for writing multiplayer computer games.  The 
game engine is easy to use, requires almost no boilerplate code, and scales 
painlessly from prototypes to full-fledged games.  The engine is driven by a 
message passing framework that was designed to be intuitive and optimized to 
avoid lag.  The game engine is also very good at noticing when it's being 
misused and explaining how it should be used with detailed error messages.  
This makes it easier to start using the engine and harder to make subtle 
synchronization bugs that would otherwise be very difficult to track down.

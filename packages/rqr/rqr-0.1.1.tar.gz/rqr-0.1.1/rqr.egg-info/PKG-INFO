        Python ReQuiRements.
        
        Handle requirements for python. Based on pip, inspired by npm. And get rid of all those different requirements.txt files.
        
        WARNING: This is alpha and a pure prototype at the moment.
        
        Installation
        ------------

        Usage
        -----
        
        Install
        ~~~~~~~
        
        WARNING: Please just one at a time for now. Does not handle multiple packages at this moment.
        
        Just like `pip install` with the possibility to `--save` your required package.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ rqr install --save django
        
            {'django': '1.9.7'}
        
        Does also support `--save-development` and `--save-production`. Default is `base` which is shared across the other two.
        
        
        List
        ~~~~

            $ rqr list
        
            base:

rqr
===

Python ReQuiRements.

Handle requirements for python. Based on pip, inspired by npm. And get rid of all those different requirements.txt files.

WARNING: This is alpha and a pure prototype at the moment.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install rqr

Usage
-----

Install
~~~~~~~

Just like ``pip install`` with the possibility to ``--save`` your required package.

.. code:: bash

    $ rqr install --save django ipython

    {'django': '1.9.7', 'ipython: '4.2.1'}

Does also support ``--save-development`` and ``--save-production``. Default is ``base`` which is shared across the other two.


List
~~~~

Shows all managed requirements, just like ``pip list``.

.. code:: bash

    $ rqr list

    base:
      - django@1.9.7
    development:
      - ipython@4.2.1

Update
~~~~~~

Checks for updates in your ``rqr.yaml`` file's packages. Does write new versions to file by default, to do otherwise use ``--dry-run`` flag.

.. code:: bash

    $ rqr update

    django 1.3.0 -> 1.9.7

Migrate
~~~~~~~

WARNING: Does override your ``rqr.yaml`` configuration if you had one before without any further warning.

Tries to discover existing requirements files or folders and migrate them. Uses current working directory and does not traverse directories deeply.

.. code:: bash

    $ rqr migrate
